Hey Bonnie,

I talked to Pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.

I spoke to Matt on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.

I'll talk to you soon and keep you updated,
Susan

Btw...that cute place on 4th Ave in Queen Anne was already rented.
