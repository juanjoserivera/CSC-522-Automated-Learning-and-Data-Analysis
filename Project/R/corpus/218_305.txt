Hey fellas, 
	It looks like I get be the wishy washy guy this week. I will need to work late tomorrow trying to get a few deliverables done by Friday. I still want to get together with you guys, since I could use the good company these days. Let me know what works for you two and I will make sure and work around the date. 

		Ps. No Kerry, this does not mean that you get the option to bail on Kevin and I at the next scheduled date.
