Rent Revenge of the Nerds sometime.  And no, it's nothing personally related to me.  

Anyway, this day is pretty much shot.  The highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building.  We move in November 9th.  Should be pretty cool.  I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.  We're going to a martini bar before hand.  Oooof, I'm going to have to find a second wind.  Must leave soon......
