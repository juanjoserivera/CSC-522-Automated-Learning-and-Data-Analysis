First off, I am still confused on how this whole thing plays out myself. I will be flying into Houston quite a lot in the short term to get a feeling for what is currently in place for EES. Tim wants Don Black to stay in place for the short term to help him make his way through this mess called EES. Don Black has not been with EES that long, so he is not being hit w/ any of the blame for the current problems. I should have a clearer picture of what is going on in the next couple of weeks.
