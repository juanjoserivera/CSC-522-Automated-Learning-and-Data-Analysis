I look forward to seeing you again on Thursday morning and to meeting Mr. Mann.  You will need to check in at the front desk in the lobby.  Usually, the process is that they will call to let me know that you are here.  My extention is 35926.  You will get a visitors badge and then you will go to the 33rd floor.  There is a reception area on 33.  I will meet you there.  --Sally Beck
