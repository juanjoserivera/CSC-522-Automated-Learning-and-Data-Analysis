I have the same recollection as to the reason for the decision.  It is my understanding that the only items being amended are receipt point entitlements and that the shippers knew these amendments would be required.  Also,  I don't know whether all of the Red Rock contracts require the receipt point amendments or only some of the agreements.  My  thoughts would be to amend as little as necessary.  -  Teb
