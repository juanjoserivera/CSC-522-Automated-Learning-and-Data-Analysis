Sales to PGE:

10/3	After you put in the lending for this day, I agree we are still out by 150 mw.  Its down to two schedules; can you check to see what you show for the Montana buy/resale.  This should be 32 peak everyday.  The other for the day is our pge system to grizzly this should be 26 mw peak.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/5 & 10/6   You show 200 more llh....I don't know why????

10/8	The 200 mw you show llh should be a total of 256 (32 llh due to colstrip).  Call me to go thru the hourly at your system to find our 2 mw descrepancy.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/9  You show 8 mw @ 24.20 under To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.  Don't know what that is?  You also only show it on one side??

I'll send more when i get thru it!!
