Thanks for the details on the flowers.  That should be enough for us to produce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer.  

David must have had a brain lapse - he forgot to mention that you had called.  Meagan and I were probably at the Bearkadette officers meeting at the time.  

We really enjoyed your visit as well!  Thanks for supporting Amanda in her musical efforts.  --Sally
