Iris,

I wrote an endorsement for his book on real options (it was on the cover 
under Jeff Skilling's
name). Let's invite him to the Thursday lunch.

Subject: FW: Possible visit to Enron by Professor Nalin Kulatilaka of  Boston 
University

Hi Stinson,

     A colleague of mine - Professor Nalin Kulatilaka of Boston University - 
is interested in visiting Enron to give a talk on work he is doing in the 
broadband area.

     Please see the forwarded emails for further information and available 
dates.

     Can you let me know if we can give him a forum at one of our Thursday 
Research lunches or a Friday brown bag lunch?

Thanks,
Iris
