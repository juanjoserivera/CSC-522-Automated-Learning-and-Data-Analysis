Well, get out there and weed, then.   Can't take Annie (too short a trip).  
I'm pretty sure that we'll be there.  Make tee times for 9 am?  You can wait 
till we see you to pay.  They did charge corkage---just a nice, not too 
expensive place.

There are a few pesky little weeds around some - not all - the tomatoes.
Lots around the melons, some in the herbs and flowers.  So you are not
taking Annie with you??  Please scout around for Liz Whiting's car keys.
They were in her purse and she can't find them now.  Look under the beds
etc. upstairs if you would please.

It had to be more than $50 per person!!!  Did they not charge the
corkage????????  Shall I mail you a check or wait till you are in  Napa?  We
would love to play golf Sunday - I will make a time if you are sure you will
be there - what time would you like??

That shirt?????????  Puh-leez.
