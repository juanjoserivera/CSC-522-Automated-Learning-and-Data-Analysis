well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is not much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm used to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time and i don't work very long days.  

i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  

your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i would be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.  

take care,
cooper
