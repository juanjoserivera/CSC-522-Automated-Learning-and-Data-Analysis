Oh, It won't be necessary to bring anything.  I don't know what the room #'s 
are.  I plan to get off @ 4pm and check in the hotel a.s.a.p.  Here's my cell 
phone # so you can call me to see where we are  (713)-320-6450.  Call me 
later and I should have all the details for you.  Oh, Candis' size is 14/16.  
Thanks Denise....talk to you soon.

Hi Dana,

    She told me it is at the Marriott.  Do you know what room and what time
yet?  Also, what can I bring?  What size does your daughter wear?
