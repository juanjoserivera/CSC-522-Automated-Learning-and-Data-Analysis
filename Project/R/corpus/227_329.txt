Sounds like a plan to me.  Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.

You might try these:

In Sedona:
  Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)

In Scottsdale/Phoenix:
  Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews)
  The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool)
  The Boulders (also highly rated)

At the Canyon
  El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)

In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon):
  The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon
