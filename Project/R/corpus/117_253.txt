John,
 
I was just thinking about the December liquidations.  We moved many deals over to a book called Bankruptcy for december forward production months.  We won't be calculating this book but I'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for Jim's (or whoever) schedule.  If they do, we will have huge OA because we killed the swaps on those physical deals, meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same.  We'll see those variances, and at the same time Financial acct. should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not "flashed" in our P&L's.
 
How can we tell if that book will liquidate this month or not?
