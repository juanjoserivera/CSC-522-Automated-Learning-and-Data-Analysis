Yes, but there's a commitment to reverse it in another bill (AB 27X) that 
Debra Bowen is carrying.  There is a helluvalot of uproar about that language 
in the bill and just about everyone is united to fix it.  Keep your fingers 
crossed, and we'll keep you posted.

Best,
Jeff

Is this statement correct?


Another flea on this legislation is the suspension of new direct access 
customers during the time that DWR is procuring energy.? The bill states, " ( 
the right of retail end use customers ( to acquire service from other 
providers shall be suspended until the department no longer supplies power 
hereunder."? Voila.? Not only do we get a rate increase, but our ability to 
choose an alternative energy supplier is hereby waived.? I would think the 
average Californian would be outraged by that dictate.? Of course, most 
Californians didn't know that they had a choice.? Therefore, the legislation 
made a grand leap forward by lowering our opportunity set to be in line with? 
expectations. 

I wonder what the Legislature will do next week?
