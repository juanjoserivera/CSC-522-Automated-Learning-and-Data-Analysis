Mark, 

Do you remember this agreement?  I think I told you to pass it along to the new lawyer when he came and I was wondering if this was done, and if I should follow up with him?  

They certainly are persistent in getting us to sign this.

Please direct me as to what I should be doing 


Regards,

Jon


PS. When you comin' back?
