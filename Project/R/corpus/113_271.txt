I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.

Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.
