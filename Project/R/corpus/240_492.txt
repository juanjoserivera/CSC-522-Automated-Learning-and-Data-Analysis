Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think that there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that part.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice.  Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for Suzanne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with Corporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay on with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this way, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Thanksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what I will do but I refuse to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out with myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?  I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the holiday season and time for (good) cheer!
