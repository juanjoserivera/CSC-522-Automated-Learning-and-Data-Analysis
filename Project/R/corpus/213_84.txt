Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no reason.

We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  

I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush us.

We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.

And by the way - where's our $60?????
