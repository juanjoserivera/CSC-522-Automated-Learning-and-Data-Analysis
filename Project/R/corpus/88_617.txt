Eric and Russell:

I spoke with Roeline Hudson at Torch just a few minutes ago.  She is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until Monday.  She answered my question, so I will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review.  The lawyer may want verification from Torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned (specifically the Dynegy trades), which evidence of authority Roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on Monday.  Roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from UOM so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents.  We will want to see the additional documentation from UOM before we send the drafts out for review.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Marie
