Dear Maaico,

Congratulations on the birth of daughter Laura!  She looks great -- very healthy and all.  It also is great to see how little Bart is growing up.  He is a beautiful boy!  You must be so happy and proud to have two healthy children.  

I will send you some fun pictures of my son, Cameron, who has learned to stand on his head -- he is very proud.

Congratulations again, and take care.

Love,

Michelle
