requested by a banking counterparty to an ISDA agreement.  Would you let me 
know if it is acceptable?

appropriate in response to any summons, subpoena, or otherwise in connection

liability, or protecting or exercising any of its claims, rights, remedies or 
interests under or in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction (iii) 
as may be obtained from a non-confidential source that disclosed such
