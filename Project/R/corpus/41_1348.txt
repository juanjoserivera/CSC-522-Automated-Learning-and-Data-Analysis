i won't be in class tonite.  i'm open, too, but to tell you the truth, mark, 
the thought of comparing us and european accounting standards/practices makes 
me break out in a rash.  if there's any way that we can focus on strategy, 
valuation, or other sorts of financial analyses that we've focused on in the 
course, that would be preferable from my perspective.

best,
Jeff

		 Subject: RE: Group Project

either day works for me and i am open to anything for the group project
if we do look at aol/tw we should probably limit our scope to a relatively
specific issue 
i'll think about this some more and perhaps we can talk at the end of break
tomorrow (say around 8-ish)
