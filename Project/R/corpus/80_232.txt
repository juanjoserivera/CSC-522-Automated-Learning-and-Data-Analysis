I love the "club" quote, because they really are.  It is a good old boy network that colludes against every day and every month.  In this case, the "club" is Reliant, Williams, Duke and others who own TW transport to SJ from Ignacio.  Our TW transport expires in Dec, so for Enron to bid firm 100% flow in the SJ, we have to price it at a discount because of the cuts through Bondad on El Paso.  We could bid higher if it was average flows or we had TW firm transport.
