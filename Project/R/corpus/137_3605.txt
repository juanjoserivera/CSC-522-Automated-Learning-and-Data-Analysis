Subject: RE: CA Development - revised documents

Kay, welcome back.  The intent is that the document package should be sent 
together, if not immediately after delivery of Notice.  When are you 
expecting the package to be delivered?  Can't it be this pm?  I'm reviewing 
the notices now.

By the way, who is Laurie Mahon?

Lisa
