We have actually been able to find that bread here at Sam's, so we are absolutely set man.  If they stop selling it, we can get it over the internet, it is just a little pricier.  You need to get us to start buying it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.  We still need to get you some soup don't we?
