Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and your firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a great team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All the best.  Jim
