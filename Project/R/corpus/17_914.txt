I may have zapped some of these updates from John since he has started this.  May be good in our budget review meeting on Monday with Louise to have all of these updates in hand - and any documentation that you all may have kept on performance issues prior to John starting this update process - as back up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on Unify in 2002 to improve performance and reliability.  Can one of you get all of these updates?  Thanks. --Sally
