I just noticed that I forgot to send you the originals of the letter 
agreements.  I will have the ABB contract picked up at the same time.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

I will send over these documents today.  Will you send over you execution
copy of the letter agreements, as I need to replace the front pages of those
agreements with the new pages which were renegotiated and initialed at
closing.  Thanks.
