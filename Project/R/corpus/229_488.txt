I may have missed it, but a VERY quick look at CNN's site showed no reports 
of computer virus activity since November.

Before sending this (or the "No Cure for this Virus") to anyone else, let me
check it out.

I'm suspect of any email - even a warning - that recommends you send it to
absolutely everyone you know.  I've forwarded it to one place, the
anti-virus people here at work.  If they're real (the viruses that is), the
tech'ies will know about them, or will know who to ask.

Hope all is well with everyone.
