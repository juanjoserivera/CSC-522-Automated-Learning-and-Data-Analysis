Ann,  I have completed the review of the comments to the Enfolio.  It might 
make the most sense to discuss these over the phone to get quicker 
resolution.  Are you available tommorrow afternoon to discuss the comments.

Hello Gerald,

Just a follow up note on the status of the review of our comments on the new
ENFOLIO.  Please give me a call or drop me a note.  I hope we can get the
contract settled.

I still have not heard what is happening with the credit side.  I have not
received signed confirms as yet.

Regards,

Ann
