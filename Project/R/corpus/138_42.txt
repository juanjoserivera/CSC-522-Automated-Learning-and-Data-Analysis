Elsa,

I was just made aware yesterday that I am to provide my direct reports the following material.  Please make a cursory review and tell Anne Koehler by noon today if you have any matters that should be added to the schedule or corrections that should be made.  I don't anticipate that you will have any issues but I am required to provide this to you.

Thanks,

Tom
