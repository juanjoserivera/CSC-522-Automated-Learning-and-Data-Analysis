Hi! 

         Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vacation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading company.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  This is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible thing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else with our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a tragedy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been retained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his job will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is going well for you and your family.  Take care!
