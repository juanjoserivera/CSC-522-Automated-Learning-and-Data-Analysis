Welcome and thanks for contacting me.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.  I'll ask my assistant to get in touch in the next couple of weeks.  Maybe we could have lunch?

Also, my wife is working with the Dean of the Rice engineering school on a history of engineering at Rice.  If your wife would like to get to know the engineering community in Houston, we may be able to help out.
