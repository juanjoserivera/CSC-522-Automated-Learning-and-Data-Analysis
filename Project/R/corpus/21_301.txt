Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	TW Daily Imbalance Report

I would like to schedule a meeting for Thursday, June 21st to review the Daily Imbalance Report Ken Powers has been developing.  The report compares the "paper" volumes with the "physical" volumes on TW on a daily basis.  This report has been developed as a tool for managing TW's linepack.  The next step will be to develop some financial analysis tools to use in conjunction with this report to help TW make operational and financial decisions on a daily basis concerning management of our OBA's, PNR and fuel.

Please let me know as soon as possible if 10:00 would be good for you or if another time on Thursday would be better.
