No - this is a serious problem

FERC is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that.  I want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier - what is the problem with starting the negotiation now.

We really cannot accept these timescales - we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place.

I'll be on the phone call  - let me know times/numbers	

Tammie - get Liz Sager to attend
