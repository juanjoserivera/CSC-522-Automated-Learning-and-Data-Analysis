Hi John!!
 
Nice car photos.   Hey I have been thinking about some sponsors here are some ideas:  Krispy Kreme Donuts (national growing donut chain--everybody loves them), Calpine Energy, Duke Energy, New York Times (they deliver locally through-out the US), Starbucks Coffee (out of Seattle),  Southwest Airlines, Champion Sportswear, Columbia Sportswear, America OnLine, Home Depot,and I could come up with some more.  Do you like any of these for a last name??  John Krispy Kreme???  
 
Sounds like things are going well for you -- give me a call sometime.
Take Care,  Your good friend, Mike.
