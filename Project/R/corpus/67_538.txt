Sorry, I read the other email first--you guys have me covered quite well.  I think the staff meeting formerly known as Mikes is on Tuesday Mar. 3, right Emily??  I didn't have anything on my calendar on the 12th.  Emily, you might want to send an email around reminding everyone of the Mar. 3 all-lawyers meeting and the secretary meeting just in case some people are assuming I'll schedule mine at different times.  Thanks all.

Drew - I have you covered for the 12th.

Em - you might cancel the Mike Moran staff meeting for 11:00 on the 12th.  I'd cover for Drew but, if I were him, I would not let me conduct his first official staff mtg with the lawyers....especially if Dot is anot availble to keep me in line..
