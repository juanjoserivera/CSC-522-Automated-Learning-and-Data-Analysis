I forgot about the happy hour.  Where is it?

I think that carpool could be pretty hectic, and since you and I haven't 
picked him up we don't know the drill.  Picking him up an  hour later might 
be a lot easier, and it doesn't bother him.

Are you going to any of tomorrow's activities?

Probably. I guess we need to tell Norris he will be picked up later. Do you
want me to send her an e-mail or wait until we talk to Paige?
Also, what about the baseball tickets? Remember this is the Vehicle Repair
Loss Control Happy Hour today at 3:30pm. I will go late and leave early as
I've told everyone I need to pick up Michael.   NM
