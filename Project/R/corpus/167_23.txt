I don't know when I'll make it to Houston next.  It's been almost a year since I've been there and that was to interview with someone else.  I like it up here but can't help but feel I may have to return to Houston sometime.  The family is fine. Kids are 8,5 and almost 2.  You can probably picture what our life is like.  Everyone is fine.
If you come up here for a game let me know, also if your son needs anything don't hesitate to ask.  I wish I sould sit in a sports bar with you and watch a game.  Not a lot of people to watch it with up here.  Haven't played golf in a long time.   I like your enthusiam when it comes to the Huskers.  I hope you are right and they decide to bring the wood every game.   I'm supposed to have some tickets through one of the brokers but haven't got them yet.  I bet I get stiffed.  I think $150 should get me in there otherwise but think I's rather watch it on tv for that much jack.  I'll get back with you later.
