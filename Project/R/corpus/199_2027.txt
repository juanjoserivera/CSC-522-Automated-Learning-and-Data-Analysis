Tammy:

Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:

(1)  We need to define "business day"  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.

(2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?

Please let me hear form you.
