Irma,

I respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.  It seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago.  So what are my options other than waiting until November 20th?

Tom
