The instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us  by COA.   The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply, or how we would schedule intraday power.  
COA wants us to "split the meter" at the plant,  allowing us to schedule our own 100 mw's ( and assume all liability) and also arrange our own gas agreement.
Otherwise,  they dont want to allow us intraday capability.
The agreement doesnt expire until Nov 3, 2003.

Their would be two gas contracts to consider,  I suppose:  Enron needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to COA directly.

When do you want to talk?
