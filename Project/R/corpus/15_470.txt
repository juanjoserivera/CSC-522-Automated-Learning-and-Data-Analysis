why don't you just make the payment to them this month and we will set up the 
arrangement next month when you have your new job

Also,  I have been meaning to talk to you.  We agreed to terms on the TV,
but I wanted to ask something Aaron's rents gave me a 4 day Window to pay
between the 18th and 22nd and as you know at this moment in time I am living
paycheck to paycheck.  I am going to have a much higher paying job within
the next month but for now I am asking that you too can give me that Window.
For instance, my next check comes on the 20th and If I am due on the 18th ,
I will be late.
