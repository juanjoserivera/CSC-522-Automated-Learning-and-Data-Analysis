Important Program Notes:  You may choose the standard desktop PC at no out-of-pocket expense. You may choose to upgrade from the standard desktop by paying the incremental cost for the hardware plus incremental shipping and tax. Only the incremental hardware charge is displayed on the Dell website. Incremental charges for shipping and tax are not displayed.  For complete and exact total charges for upgrades, call Dell at 1-866-220-3355.  Only one subsidized system may be ordered per eligible employee.  Orders may be placed on the Enron/Dell website or by calling Dell at 1-866-220-3355.  Windows 2000 may not be compatible with all hardware and software. Please check compatibility before purchasing items that will be used with your ClickAtHome PC.  Note that UPS will deliver your PC "Signature Required" and plan accordingly. DO NOT DELIVER YOUR COMPUTER, OR ITS COMPONENTS, TO AN ENRON BUILDING OR SITE, as the mailroom will not be responsible for it. Enron will not bear the risk of loss if you do not receive the shipment.  Validation of your payment may prolong your ordering schedule. 	 <../document/dellwalkthrough.pdf>  <../document/dellwalkthrough.pdf>  <hardware_dell.asp>  <hardware_dell.asp>
