Jeff,

I'll focus on the consolidation agreement today.

It seems to me that the time GE has to remit the payment to ENA should 
remain  3 days.  I don't see a reason to stretch it to  7 days, since it 
represents a double payment.  Your thoughts?

Looks like the tax issues are completed.

Kay

Subject: FW: Letter Agreement


AGREED!
I just corrected what I think is a typo ("has" instead of "as", in a
Whereas), and changed the 3 to a 7 for days.
All we need is the Consolidation Agreement.
Per our last telecon, we should only be making statements dealing with the
fact that we have two contracts instead of one, not adding statements or
taking actions etc, which should be accomplished under one or the other
contract.
Regards,
Jeff Smith
