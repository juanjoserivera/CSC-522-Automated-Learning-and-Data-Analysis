Billy,

I have received an invitation to speak to a graduating class of
the Quantitative and Computational Finance program at Georgia Tech.
The URL is included in the message below.

Would you be interested in arranging for  a presentation at this school
about the A/A Program, coinciding with my visit?

Vince
