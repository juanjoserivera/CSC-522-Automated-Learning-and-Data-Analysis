As I was discussing with Duncan, I'm coming home Wednesday night and coming back to Houston on Monday late afternoon.  During some portion of the holiday, I'll be up at the islands, but i'm free to hang out for a day or so.  Are you around Thursday? Where would you go rafting anyway?  I'm definitely looking forward to the holiday, though.  A little barbaque, a little beer, a little boating, a little fishing, a little beer, a little golfing...I guess I should have taken the whole week off.  Anyway, give me a call sometime, and I'll try you when I get chance.  

Talk to you soon.

Mateo
