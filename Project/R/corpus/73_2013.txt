Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.
