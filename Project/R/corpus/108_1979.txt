Subject: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications
             

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions 
for ENA,s NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications 
require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents 
have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any related 
commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with another person 
pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany 
email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001 
if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in 
any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate 
account).

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO 
THIS REQUEST.
