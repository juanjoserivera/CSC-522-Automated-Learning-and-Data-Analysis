Seems to me that we need to engage in AZ (along with NV and OR?) in the Western states to try and push competition forward.  Why don't we first assemble a (1) what we know - what we don't know memo and then (2) look at oppotunities to push our agenda.  

Leslie - everyone is looking to you to lead us to the promised land in AZ...  GO GET 'EM!!!!!!
