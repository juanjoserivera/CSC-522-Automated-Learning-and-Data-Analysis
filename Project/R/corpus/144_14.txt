All,

Attached is a draft copy of a presentation that was created as an internal 
briefing document on the business activities within EGM.  The purpose of this 
presentation is to communicate our activities and provide individuals with a 
more detailed reference document on these businesses in case they come up in 
Q&A.

This is a confidential and internal document, which includes earnings 
targets, goals and objectives.  We also have a shorter and more external 
version if you are interested. 

Please don,t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like 
to discuss this in more detail.  

Mike
