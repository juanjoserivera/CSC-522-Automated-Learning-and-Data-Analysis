I agree with Christi's point.  The problem is that those arguments - effectively that real competition will take away market power - are no longer effective at FERC.  I think that Massey and Wood are ready to do something more potent.  My primary question is how do we think that Appendix A would apply to Enron?  Do we want Hirenymous (sp?) to undertake a proxy exam to see the real impact?  
 
I am going to try and schedule a phone call for next Friday to outline our next steps.  Should anyone else be in on the call?  Who else could lead this analysis for us (given that we are all so busy)?
