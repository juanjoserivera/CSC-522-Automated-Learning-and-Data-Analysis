The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is 
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of 
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the 
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.  

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been but 
heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??   I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!
