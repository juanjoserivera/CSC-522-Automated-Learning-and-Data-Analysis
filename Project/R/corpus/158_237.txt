Comments from trading track phone interviews:


Fred Baloutch  -  recommendation: invite in for interview  -  excellent academic results, very smart, some summer gas experience with BC gas, did some work with weater derivatives,  very enthusiatic 

Carlos Betancourt  -  recommendation: do not invite for interview - unable to communicate relavent experience.

Seung "Sam" Hyun Cho -  recommendation:  invite for interview ( however, Sam does not graduate until May '02, so Associate program recruiting may be a better fit.)  excellent academic results,  able to discuss a wide variety of subject material regarding trading,  strong understanding of risk and derviatives. 


Please let me know if you need additional information.
