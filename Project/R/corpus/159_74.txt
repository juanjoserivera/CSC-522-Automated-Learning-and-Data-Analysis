That is hilarious.  You know it is a good party when you make the news.  Just 
talked to Ernie.  He didn't have your new email and work #.  He is planning 
on coming up for the Rice game.  You should be hearing from him shortly.

I do have your charger. Hey, did you no there was a camera at the dock when
we left and we were on the 10 o clock news. The story was about drunks on
the water.
