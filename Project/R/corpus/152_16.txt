Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel?  It is the Westin.  Also, who is Jason and what are HS numbers?  As far as delivery point, yes, it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren (the LDC).  Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements.  Also, I did meet with Jeff Hodge, our attorney, and I know the details regarding the contract.  I'll be in the office until around 10:30.

Thanks
