Virtual Bidding Questions

1)	How is uplift allocated when there is thunderstorm alert in NYC?  Is the uplift allocated to those short going into the real time
 in Zone J/K only or is it allocated statewide?
2)	When is uplift allocated statewide as opposed to superzone?
3)	Are credit amounts going to be adjusted and when?  Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure.

Thanks Tom
