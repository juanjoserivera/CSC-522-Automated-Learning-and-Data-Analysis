Michael,

It's a cottage industry and nobody can read all that's
published.  The Journal of Derivatives and
the Journal of Finance are two primary publications I would recommend.

Hi Grant and Vince,

What do you think of the Journal of Derivatives?  Would you recommend a
subscription?  If not, which publication would you suggest?

Thanks,
Michael
