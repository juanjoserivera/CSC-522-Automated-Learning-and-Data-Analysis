Hi Steve,
             
                I spoke to Jeff Hodge this morning. Jeff asked that I provide to you the pipeline contracts we will need to put into place for the East Trading desk as soon as possible after  we find out who is going to buy us.  As expected the pipelines would only provide us will shell sgreements but we would like to get a step ahead by having legal review them so we can hopefully turn them around quickly when credit is established with the new entity.  You should receive them this afternoon.  I am at X35775.

                                                                                                                    Thank you!
