Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.  You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up kayaking.  Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.  It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We also hit "the Bite" which was really neat.

Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan
