Here is the file.  It contains only financial trades in the active NG-PRICE book.  Also these are only Price, Basis, Index, and Gas Daily values.  They don't contain any Options.  I will get another book set up so we can move only positive net value deals with counterparties.  Let me know if you have any questions.
