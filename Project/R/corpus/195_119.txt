Hey Sarah, 

Nice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to Lisa the other day so I got a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and Mike are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.  I wish I was planning the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have you been to Seattle before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit.  Hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together when you come back to Texas...

Sue
