Dear Professor Hu, thank you for your message.  Your participation by telephone, for whatever portion of your afternoon might be free, would be very welcome.  I currently plan to be in Austin for the UT Law School Foundation Board meeting and related matters on November 9 and 10.  Perhaps our paths will cross there.  All the best.  Jim Derrick
