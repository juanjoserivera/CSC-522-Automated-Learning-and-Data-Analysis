Both, I would like to have a complete understanding of what MSAL will provide upon completion. Also, I would like to set up a meeting with you sometime tomorrow to get your input on some of the issues I am running into on the lack of a given baseline in most of the contracts that the KPMG group are going through. Thanks for your help on these items.
