I think what I will do is send out an email today to have people call you 
directly and reserve a room.  We can then see how many short we are, and deal 
with the deposit.  I will tell them to inform you that they are with the 
Enron group.  Names of the individuals should be as follows;

Kay Mann (I'll call with my card soon - I want the Premier)
Heather Kroll
Barbara Gray
Peggy Banczak
Lisa Bills
Rose Engeldorf
Nora Roberts
Anne Koehler
Lisa Mellencamp
Christi Nicolay
Gail Brownfeld

Maybe this will help identify those who are REALLY in.  There may be a couple 
of new ones also. 

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Kay,

If we hold the rooms with the prepayment I would need a cancellation before
March 23rd in order to fully refund the pre-payment amount.  Let me know
what you think, I work with you however I can.

Cindy
