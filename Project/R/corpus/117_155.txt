Do you guys know which books each of your people will be doing?  There is a column for that in the trader matrix under the controls folder.  Ramesh will be loading our information into risktrac for us once we have all of the information, book admin id is one of the fields he needs. 

When you have decided can you please input that into the trader matrix and I'll then forward everything to Ramesh.

Thanks

Kam
