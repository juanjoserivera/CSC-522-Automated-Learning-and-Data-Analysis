John,

I will need 1 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate.  I have talked to Bryan Hull (third year analyst) about a one year rotation at our desk.  He spent his first rotation in the Texas Risk Group and did a great job.  His second rotation has been in the EOL Marketing Group.  He is interested in trading and is a sharp guy.  I would like to see some of the other folks coming in just to compare against him and to see if using an associate is a viable option for my cash trading needs.

Tom
