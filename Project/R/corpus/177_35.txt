agh.  i just spent 2.5 hours opening a bank account!  banking in this country sucks.  i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada, but the banking system is brutal.  yeah, working for a law firm is sweet, i see the same perks here working for a management consulting firm.  i'm glad you briefed the ladies on the naked yoga, maybe janice could give us a demo.  are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight?  we talked about it long ago... and i do want to see it.  

glad to see you are breaking in your email account.  -c
