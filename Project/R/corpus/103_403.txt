Thanks.  I have heard from just about all of Steve's reports about retaining him.  Steve was given the choice to stay at ETS.  He made the choice that was in his and Enron's best interest.  Steve is a quality individual and an exceptional leader.  His talents need to be showcased and I think he understood that.  I appreciate your comments on Steve's replacement.  We have finished the interviewing process and will make a choice in the next couple of weeks or sooner.  Your recommendation is appreciated.  Thanks again for the kind words.

Stan
