Kelly will be a power trader.  I don't know if she has any experience doing that.  
I haven't heard exactly why the weather group left, but many of the traders weren't happy that the move was a lateral one and didn't accept their offers.  I think that's what happened with them.  
Good luck with everything, it would be great to work with you again.
