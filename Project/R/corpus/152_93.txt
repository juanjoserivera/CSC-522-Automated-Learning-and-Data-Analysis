Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs
