No need to apologize! I figured you were busy doing something.  We did not go skiing yesterday, it seems that even though we are in a period of "No Work" something always comes up and needs to be done immediately.  I will be around tonight.  I would of tried you later Monday night but I didn't get back to my house until after nine and last night I was at the Nuggets' game watching the San Antonio Spurs, my hometown team, have their way with the Nuggets.  I'll call you after 8:00 pm MST.  If it works tonight great if not I'll keep trying.  You can fill me in on your job.

Paul
