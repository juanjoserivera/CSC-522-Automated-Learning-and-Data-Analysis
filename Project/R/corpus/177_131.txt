cell number is:  512 3312 but it's enron's phone, so ...

home number is 262 0205 and cooper@llamacom.com should be a good place to reach me.

as for me, i'm very unsure.  I'm still technically a U.S. employee and my visa expires soon, 
so I really don't have any idea.  

worst case is i take a well-deserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later ... :)
