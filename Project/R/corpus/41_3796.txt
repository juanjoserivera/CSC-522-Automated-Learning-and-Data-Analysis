Interesting.  

Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really need to get certified for diving."

Question 2: How hot is it down there?

Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer?
