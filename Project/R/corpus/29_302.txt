Bill, I have this outstanding bill notice which I keep getting form iPayit.  There are about 5 invoices from Argent for EOTT work which they did in 2001. It was for the Midland EOTT compliance stuff. I dont know how to let the system know that these invoices have been taken care of.  Is there someone you know of who can let iPayit know that these invoices have been taken care of?
