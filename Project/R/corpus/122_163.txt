well - it's okay -- alot of people here are really confident about going head to head with dynegy traders and kicking their asses -- and i've had a pretty good year so i'm not that worried -- but - that said -- i do have a couple things lined up just to see if there's something better -- what about you?  did you get your interview at pan can yet??
