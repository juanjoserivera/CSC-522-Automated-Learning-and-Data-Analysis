These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National Charity League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in Austin for interviews!  --Sally
