Linda, 
	I am ok with the  most of the Audit plan except for the date of completion. August 2001 seems quite excessive since we now have one SQMD audit under our belts. Please provide to me the logic behind the thought that this Audit will take over 3mths to complete. 

								Thanks
								 Chris
