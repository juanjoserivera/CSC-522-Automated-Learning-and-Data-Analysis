Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.  Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex.
