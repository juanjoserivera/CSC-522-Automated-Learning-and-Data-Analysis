The only comment  on the structures transaction slide is that 

(i) They are not from this quarter 
(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.
