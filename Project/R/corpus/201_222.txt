Jeff,

It's great to hear from you!  Things are going extremely well. It seems that 
things are going well with you.  I tried to meet with you when you were on 
the trading floors. I  know you are extremely busy. 

As for the IPAQ, you will receive the following:

? extra 1GB Drive
? Cellular Modem to access email and the internet remotely
? Expansion Sleeve
? Extra cradle

I will schedule to meet with your assistant to assess when to convert you to 
Windows 2000 and setup the IPAQ.   I hope to see you when I come by.  

Thanks again for the opportunity here at Enron.  It's been great!!!!

LaMetrice
