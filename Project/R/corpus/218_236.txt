Ken,

	First of all, sorry for the mix up last week that is all on me. As far as the comment on the SQMD, Murray wants to take a look at the responses which should happen this morning or early afternoon. I would also like to schedule some time this week to sit down and talk about some questions that I have about the audit that fall outside of my responses. Once again I  apologize for the delay and I will have something to you ASAP.
