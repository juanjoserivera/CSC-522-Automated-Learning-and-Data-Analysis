Thanks for that laugh! I needed it.

Here's the deal:

A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.  I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars. I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.  I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.

My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying Enron.

My new Company is called  "Cara-land".  I am working on the national anthem now.
