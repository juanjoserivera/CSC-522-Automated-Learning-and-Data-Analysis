Keoni,

	I realize that there are no penalty charges associated to Load, I am referring to the neg. and positive load deviation. What are all of the charges associated to the penalties for deviation from schedule. 

	Ps  Jim, take your best cut at what you think these charges are and then get Keoni too sign off on what results you come up with. We need to put every charge that we think is linked to a schedule and then just have Keoni fill in the gaps and sign off on the document.
