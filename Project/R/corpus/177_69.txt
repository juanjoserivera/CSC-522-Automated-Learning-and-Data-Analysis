Greg/Dan,

now that things are firming up, can you give me a summary of what is happening to all of the servers purchased for trading decision support (i.e., fundamentals).  the ones i had to get zufferli to sign off on purchasing were power-fs1, nacal-sqws001p, nacal-sqws001d and the 3 pizza boxes.  i know there is some shuffling around now, but i'd like to know what the plan is for these in the short term and long term (either estate/ubs share, estate only, or ubs only). 

thanks,
cooper
