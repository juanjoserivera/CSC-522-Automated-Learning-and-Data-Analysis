I am still here.  I have a contract through March 1 of next year, so I should be here at least until then.  The absolute destruction of the company has been pretty brutal - some of the people lost everything in their 401K.  I guess they really believed in the company.  We should still be in town in Feb. just let us know when the party is and we will be there.
