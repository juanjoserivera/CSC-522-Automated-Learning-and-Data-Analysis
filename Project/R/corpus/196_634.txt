Congratulations and yes you did.  I of course will be sad to see you go but I 
know this is something you really wanted and therefore I can be nothing but 
pleased for you.  I'd tell you to have fun this weekend in NY, but telling 
you to have a good time in NY is like telling a sprinter to run fast.  

As for myself I'm doing well.  I had incredible seats at the Opera Friday and 
spent the rest of the weekend in Austin so all in all it was a great weekend.
Remind me again where you will be based in the new job (I thought NY but 
wasn't sure).  Also, when do you make the Big Move?

As I've said before keep me posted on all your endeavors...they are always 
interesting.

I think you already hold pretty true to the statement below, but it never 
hurts to be reminded.


"For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real 
life. But there was always some
obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished 
business, time still to be served, 
or a debt to be paid.  Then life would begin.  At last it dawned on me that 
these obstacles WERE my "life."
            
So, treasure every moment that you have...and remember that time waits for no 
one...

So stop waiting

                                                until you finish school,

                                              until you go back to school,

                                               until you lose ten pounds,

                                               until you gain ten pounds,

                                                  until you have kids,

                                            until your kids leave the house,

                                                 until you start work,

                                                    until you retire,

                                                 until you get married,

                                                until you get divorced,

                                                   until Friday night,

                                                 until Sunday morning,

                                            until you get a new car or home,

                                           until your car or home is paid off,

                                                     until spring,

                                                    until summer,

                                                       until fall,

                                                     until winter,

                                               until you are off welfare,

                                               until the first or fifteenth,

                                               until your song comes on,

                                                until you've had a drink,

                                                until you've sobered up,

                                                     until you die,

                                                until you are born again

                             to decide that there is no better time than 
right now to be happy(

                                        Happiness is a journey, not a 
destination.
