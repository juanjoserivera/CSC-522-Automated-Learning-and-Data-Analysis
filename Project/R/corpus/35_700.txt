Thanks so much.  I'm sending your revisions to Scott for review.  The
Confirmation Reply has been totally red lined out of these attachments, but
I am assuming that it remains as we originally designed it.  Please advise
if this is not correct.  If your changes are accepted, I will print a copy
and have Scott McGough execute it.  Please give me your fax number so that I
can fax it to you.  Regards, Lin Reece
