Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).
 
Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).
 
Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.
 
Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day.
