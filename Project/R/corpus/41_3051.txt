I'm not positive.  The best way to find out is to call the Public Advisor at the PUC directly.  He'll be happy to fill you in on how to get on the list of speakers.  And I'm sure it's very easy to do.  I'll definitely give you a heads up regarding the Wednesday calls, though they've really wound down alot since the Legislature took off for vacation.  Hope all is well.
 
Best to you and yours,
Jeff
