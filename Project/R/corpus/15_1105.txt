where are you working now - i know you worked for that motorcycle company - do you still work there?  jason's fiancee (sorry no fancy accent) had been a friend of his for awhile. They started dating about a year and a hlaf ago and got engaged about 6-7 months ago.  She is very nice and we get along just fine.  
Thanksgiving was good - I stayed out at the the parents house for a couple of days and went up to college station on friday for the game.  How about you?
Glad to hear that Lucky is well.
