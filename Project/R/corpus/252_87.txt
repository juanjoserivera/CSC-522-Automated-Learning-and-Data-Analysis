Steph,
Great to hear from you. I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet. Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me. It should be good for our stock price though. One can hope anyway.
Glad to hear you guys are doing well. Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer. You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door.
And my liver will likely always be in shape.

Take care.

B
