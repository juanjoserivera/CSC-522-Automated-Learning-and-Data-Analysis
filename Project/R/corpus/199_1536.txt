		 Subject: Total International v24545

From a credit standpoint, potential risk of this 25,000 bbls/mo, May'01, 
financial swap is very small.  But I recognize ECP issues since no support 
and no information has ever been available.  Can we include a representation 
that, upon execution, would establish eligibility.  I will manage credit 
under volume/tenor limits and implied support of a AA parent.  If acceptable, 
please send language to Confirmations for use in this (v24545) and all future 
trades.

thanks
brant
