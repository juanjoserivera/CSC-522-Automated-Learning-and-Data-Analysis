That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!
