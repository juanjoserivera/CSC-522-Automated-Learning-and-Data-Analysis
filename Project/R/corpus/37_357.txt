I love Aigerim and visited with her on my recent trip to Taraz.  I took lots of pictures of Aigerim and
if you send me your mailing address I'll send them.  I am very interested in Aigerim's placement.  Let me know either way about your decision.  If you decide not to adopt her I would love to continue to advocate for her.
