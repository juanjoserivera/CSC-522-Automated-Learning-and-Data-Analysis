Subject: RE: CPCN proceeding - AG intervention

The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I think
misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement.
