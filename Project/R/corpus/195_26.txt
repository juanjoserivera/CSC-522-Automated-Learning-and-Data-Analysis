I'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but I fear alas my liver would go on strike, and from what I understand the liver is a fairly vital organ...my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last Friday.

Despite all of this I still look forward to engaging in engrossing AND coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight.

By the way, do we have a particular time in mind?
