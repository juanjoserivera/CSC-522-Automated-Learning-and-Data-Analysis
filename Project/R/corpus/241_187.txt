Because  I had an updated curve for PG&E and not for Malin.  I asked the Malin trader - he hadn't updated his curves but the other guy had.   I am going to start asking so that I am consistant.  Let me know what you want to do and I will show you transactional numbers.

Thanks for letting me know.

Kim

Kim,

Do you know why the winter strip (November 2002 through March 2003) is lower
at PG&E Citygate ($7.30) than at Malin ($7.49)?

I will call you tomorrow to let you know what I want to buy.

Thanks

Monica
