I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.
