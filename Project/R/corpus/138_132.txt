I think last year anyway the bulkhead issue only affected relays as we started all individual events from the blocks and move the timers for 25 and 50 yard swims.  No matter, I am over the "Kein Oak" deal and moving on to "Klein" just suggesting we look into the possibility of using their gym for the teams.  I will talk to Becky about the rates and pass it on when we get.  Have a great weekend!
