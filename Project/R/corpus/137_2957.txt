I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their 
power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it.

Kay:

I will review your comments on the LOI.  I wanted to check with make sure 
that someone at King & Spalding is reviewing the Midway term sheet along with 
the LOI, so that we can send the term sheet to TECO on Monday/Tuesday.

Let me know.

Fred
