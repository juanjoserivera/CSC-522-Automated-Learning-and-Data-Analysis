Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in Austin this weekend.  

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion, do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.  

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing you!

Paul
