You are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should be:

	1) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition, risk systems, deal capture system, status of 	projects, schedule, etc.)
	2) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff,  and gas)
	3) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East tariffs)
	4) Bernie presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal valuation, new model construction)
	5) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio valuation - works with Richter)
	6) You and I find the holes and provide direction.

Your thoughts?
