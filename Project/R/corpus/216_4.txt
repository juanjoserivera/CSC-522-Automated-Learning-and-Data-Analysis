Good Morning Jonda,

Please send a reply fax to Miryam and let Tonya now the reason my own son does not know me better is because she won't let him see his own father.  As for the visitation, I hope this will soon end with her making all of the decisions but in the mean time I will talk to my family to see what is best.  I know if I choose to see him on Sunday, I would need to see him in the morning from 9 to 12:00. My flight is @ 5:30 and I'm 3 hours away from the airport.  I will let you know sometime this afternoon or first thing in the morning.

Thank you,
-Joe
