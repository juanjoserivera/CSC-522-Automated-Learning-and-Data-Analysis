Bruce,

The 600K is salary, and nonperformance related bonus payouts.  It is NOT guaranteed bonus over and above salary (I wish it was).  Basically, I am 95% certain I will make a minimum of 600K/year with either company, worst case I'm looking at 500K/year (excluding incentive).  Incentive would be in addition to.  My offer would have to be in that ballpark.  If I worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, I would get 100 less.  Also, I'm not trying to be vague.  Essentially I'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet.  At this point, let's look at this:  2-year contract with an out after 1-year.  $275 base salary.  $225 signing bonus.  $225 retention bonus after 1-year.  If I take it, I'm done for another year.  Participation in the 17% incentive package.  Relocation package.  That seems to be the ballpark we are in.

Thanks,

Sean
