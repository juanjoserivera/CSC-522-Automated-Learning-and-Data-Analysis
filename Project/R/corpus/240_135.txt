Funny - I get an email from you and Keith Aaron on the same day!  Not much going on - just settling down and staying home a while since I traveled non-stop June and July.  I have planned to go to Aruba in October (16th - 20) and then to St. Martin etal in January.Come to Aruba and bring friends.  We are staying at the Allegra Resort all-inclusive.  But we are somewhat boring - sun, san, surf, and a few suds.

Let me know what else is going on!  Oh, yeah - my home email address is kward1@houston.rr.com.  My boss is nosy and reads my emails!

Take Care,

Kimmie
