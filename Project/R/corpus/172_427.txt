I am glad to hear that the move went well. I am sure that you will do great and that you will learn alot.
I do not know if you got a hold of Kori or not but she has been here during the week and gone on the weekends.
I will be in sunny Florida this weekend and will be thinking of all my gator friends : )

Hope everything is going great
