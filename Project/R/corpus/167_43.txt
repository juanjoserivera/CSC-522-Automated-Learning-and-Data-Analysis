Hey Dave,

Of course I remember you! And you were right, Saturday the 25th was my birthday(37).  I feel especially old
now that I am surrounded by 24year olds.  I wish some old people like you were still around.

How dou you like Phoenix? and SRP?
And how is your family getting along?

I have 3 kids now.  The last one is 19 mos old. I am done. 
We have more and more people around here.  I am the last of the "Texans" . The rest all went back to Houston.  Brett Hunsucker went to ERCOT in Austin.  I think he likes it.  Miller and Forney and Smith Day are all working for Enron on the ERCOT desk.
I can't trade this place for Houston.
Drop me a line Dave. Its been good to hear from you!
