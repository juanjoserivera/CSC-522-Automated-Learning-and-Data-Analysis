Dear Colleagues,
 
On numerous occasions this past year, Enron Government Affairs (EGA) support 
provided to commercial groups resulted in substantial increases in project 
economics and enhanced the overall value of many deals. The Regulatory Risk 
Analytics group has been tasked to help you quantify EGA,s portion of this 
value added over the past year. For budgetary reasons, it is critical for 
every EGA member to participate in this exercise and document his/her share 
of significant value added.  Please contact Gia Maisashvili or John Neslage 
to discuss the  methodology for determining EGA,s value added as soon as 
possible.   The contact information for Gia is (713)  853-4346, and for John 
its (713) 853-6827.

The dead line for this effort is Friday,  September 1st

Thank you for your cooperation
