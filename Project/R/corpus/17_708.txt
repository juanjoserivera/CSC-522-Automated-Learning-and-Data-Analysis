I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe that person could shed light on this for both of us. 

There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn't match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if that is where this is coming from?  Norma (whose last name I don't know) who works for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC name that was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously seem to relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported in through Operations.  When I asked Norma to read me the names of employees in that RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.  I told her that we had not used the term "IBS" in a while.  Norma asked if the RC name should be consistent with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes sense and she said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a name change, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this info gets us back on the right track.  --Sally
