Kim and John,
     I agree with Kim's second point.  I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific.  I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself.  Can we clean this language up a little?
