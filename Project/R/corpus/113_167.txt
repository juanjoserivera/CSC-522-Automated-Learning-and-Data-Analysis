Amy Kim is still an open question.
I think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy?
I want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount.
I'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past).
