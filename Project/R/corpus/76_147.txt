I bought the tickets the week of the Texas-OU game.  Up until Sat night, I was planning on selling them to a guy I work with who went to OU.  I never thought about a hotel because I really never thought UT would be in the game.  I really don't want to put you guys out, especially with a new baby.  We are bringing Christopher (he is really excited about going) and a high school aged neighbor (his girlfriend's brother is on the team).  If you truly don't mind, then I will talk to Kristi about it.  We'll see.  How's the new house?  Is Flower Mound a little west of Lewisville?  I'm not good on Dallas geography.
