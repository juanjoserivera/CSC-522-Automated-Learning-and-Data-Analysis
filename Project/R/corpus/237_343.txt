Mike, for your info... we just received this message from IGS re: DWR purchases.  As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...

It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.
