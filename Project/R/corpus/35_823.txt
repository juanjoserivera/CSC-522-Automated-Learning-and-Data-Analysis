Ann:
I will do that.  Just to clarify, he will need to sign off on all of the 
changes, which I hope I can walk him through.  The only language that I am 
concerned about is what I have marked as "under review".  I will copy you on 
what i send to him as I will edit your draft to make my changes.  I will be 
leaving to go on maternity leave shortly (probably no later than July 14th) 
and if for some reason we don't conclude this, Mark Taylor will handle

Carol, please go ahead and have the 'under review' sections of the draft
read by the Enron Online person for approval, as the remaining comments are
not contentious.
I will send the mark-up to Marketing to see while we await for your reply.

Thank you
Anne Love
