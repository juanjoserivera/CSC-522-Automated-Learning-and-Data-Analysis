Hi Chris,

I don't know where you're at with things ...

i've been impressed how you've handled both the databases and the people involved with databases and
would be happy to provide you with a solid reference if you ever need one.  please keep this to yourself
as I don't feel this way about many people here ...

cheers :)

Cooper
