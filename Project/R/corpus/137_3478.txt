Hi Kathleen,

I'm having difficulty reading parts of paragraphs 15 and 17.  Are these 
jumbled on your screen?

Thanks,

ckm

Subject: 2001 Form of Option to Purchase

Attached is our new form of Option for 2001.  FYI the following Paragraph was 
included in the Illinois Option Agreements, but we did not include in the 
North Carolina Options.  We may want to include in others if you think it is 
important:

29. Cooperation
Optionors shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of Optionee with 
regard to Optionee obtaining all approvals necessary for Optionee to 
construct the proposed Project. Optionors shall take no action or make no 
public statement which could be detrimental to Optione,s achievement of said 
approvals.
