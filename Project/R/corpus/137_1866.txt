Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient.  

I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is not 
enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the Portland 
team wants to sign the documents.

Kay:

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands (i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.
