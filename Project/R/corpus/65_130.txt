Chris,
Good questions:
1. You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.    Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.       If we wish to schedule mw's across a path,  ie South to North,  we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.     We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission,  rather,  this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.
Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.  I will let you know what it is called.

2.  The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.
My fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.    We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet,  as Real Time has done for MDEA.     
The location for this spreadsheet is:

M:Eservices/applications/services

We will request access to this tool for everyone.

Thanks,
JMF
