I prefer the weekend.  It gives us a reason to get in and get out.

No reason other than I don't really care to go.

I really would like to do the FtW Show. Would weekends work best for you? I
checked TicketMaster and all the weekend shows are available, even the "sold
out" shows. I didn't check the price. They do have some weekday shows also
if you would rather do that.
