Kristen,

Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  

After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  Greg Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.  


Thanks

Kam
