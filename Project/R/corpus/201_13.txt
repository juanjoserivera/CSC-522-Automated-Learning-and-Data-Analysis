Hi, thanks for the update.  Per was in Houston last week,  and I've asked him 
to get with you soon.  Please call him (he should be expecting your call) at 
our office in NY at.   212-702-3910.  Would you also like to come to houston 
for a visit and interview?   Jeff

Jeff,
Quick update.  I called Jeff to see if is going to be in NY next week, his
sec. said that he's out of the office today and apparently not scheduled to
be in NY next week.  I am hoping that we will talk soon.  No call for Per
(sp?) in the NY office.  Hope you are well,
Nat
