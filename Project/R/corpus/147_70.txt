How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.   

Let me know what you want to do.

Jon
