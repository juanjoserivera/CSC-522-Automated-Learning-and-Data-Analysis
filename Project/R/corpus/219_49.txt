Joseph,

	Hunter will be in Chicago on the 17th, but I reserved a conference room from 2:30-4:00pm. 
	Myself, Martin Cuilla (Ontario Trader) and Patrice Thurstan (Chicago Trader) will be in attendance. 

	Enron is located at 1400 Smith St. and gas trading is in on the 32nd floor.
	Call me from the security desk dowstairs when you arrive (713-853-7058).

	See you soon.

	Geof Storey
