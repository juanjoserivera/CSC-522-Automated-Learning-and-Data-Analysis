Richard,
       Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.
       Judy and the kids are doing fine.  We do see London alumni on a regular basis.  Are you going to be here over the holidays?  We'd love to see you guys. Let me know what your calendar looks like.

Dan
