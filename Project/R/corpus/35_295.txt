Christian will be handling this with Rhonda's assistance as this is an area

Carol,

I tried to contract Morgan yesterday but Debbie Hart said she would have to 
call me back.  If I don't hear from here by noon, I will give her another 
call.  Also, I am assuming that you will be handling adding the product 
definitions as indicated below in the amendment.  Let me know if this is not 
the case.

Wendy
