standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like.  Make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out.  The problem is I am sure everyone wants to get out for New Year's Eve so you might generate hard feelings.  I have nothing to do because I consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and I always stay home.  You decide what you want to do and we will work around it.  If you stay here, I have always heard the Hyatt has a great party and room rate all included.  I am sure other hotels have the same.
