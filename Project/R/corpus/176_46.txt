Good question.  I would like the 2 games but this is not about me.  Jr. Monopoly may be a little too much for her still.  She would probably enjoy the Dr. Barbie or the computer game the most.  But she will want to play the game on the computer right then so Mom better be prepared for that.

Hope y'all are having fun.

Love,

Jay
