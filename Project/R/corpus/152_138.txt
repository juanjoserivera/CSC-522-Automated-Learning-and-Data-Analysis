Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.  I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.
