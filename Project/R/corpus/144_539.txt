Subject: Introduction to Eric Gonzales

Mike, 
In the interest of time, I'd like to call Eric Gonzales directly.  Please, 
would you make an introduction.  My company description is below.  We've 
covered the LNG industry for over ten years and have some ideas that fit with 
Enron's trading strategy.
Thanks, 
Bob Nimocks
