Mike:
I am "re-commenting" on the last redlined draft that you sent to us.  I 
believe that you had received comments from Marie Heard on this draft and I 
am looking at those comments and seeing what we can live with and what we 
can't.

Carol:

My fax number is (713) 350-4802.  Thanks for helping me move this along.

Just for my edification, are you commenting on OEMI's old draft, new draft,
or resending yours?

Mike
