Chris -

I did discuss Enron's payment issues with PJM with our team.

To make sure that we are on the same page.

1.	No additional collateral is required at this time.
2.	EPMI owes on 12/20/01 = $1,704,182.63
	EESI owes on 12/20/01 = $134,456.58
3.	The Annual Fee is also due on 12/20/01 = $5,000 (one fee for all affiliated companies).

I will call you tomorrow.

Jim
