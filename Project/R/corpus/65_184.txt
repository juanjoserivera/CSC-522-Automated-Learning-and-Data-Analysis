Lloyd,
I received this from Preston.    It appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch.   
We were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that EES was to provide.
We havent received the necessary information,  so no choice has been made yet.

Please see the attached and let me know your comments.
