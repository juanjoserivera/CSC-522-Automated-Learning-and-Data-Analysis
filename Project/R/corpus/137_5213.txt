Isabel,

I'm waiting on Delta to give me language concerning a performance guarantee 
adjustment for site conditions before turning the execution version.  

The GE parent guaranty and LOC are in the all the earlier versions I sent, 
and remain unchanged.  Please let me know if you don't have the earlier 
versions.

Kay

Do you know when we might receive a revised Turbine Contract?  The lenders
would like to review the GE parent guarantee.
Thank you
Isabel
