The water could be 100 feet or more away from the dock, depending on how long 
it blows that hard.   I hope our shrimp come back.

Both!
I agree that having Matt come to our house the first time is best.
I had already looked at the weather. North winds to 25 mph. How much water
would be left in the bay?
Connecticut's new. You haven't been there with Enron have you? Better take a
coat!! Saturday the 14th is my Saturday to work. I can bring Michael with me
if necessary. No big deal.
