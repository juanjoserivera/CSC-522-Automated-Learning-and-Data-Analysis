I received an auto-reply email from Terry Tang indicating that she is on vacation and that I should forward this to you.  In the meantime,  I have spoken to Ken Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO.  He said that he would be happy to put his name to the letter if that would improve its chances for publication.  Let me know.
