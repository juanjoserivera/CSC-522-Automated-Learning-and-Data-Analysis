Gentlemen, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London (in connection with one of our mattters that was being heard by 5 of the Law Lords of the House of Lords) and found your message. I will coordinate travel plans with Bobby.  I am very honored to be included in this most memorable event. All the best.  Jim
