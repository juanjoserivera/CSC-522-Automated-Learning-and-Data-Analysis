touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 
15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good 
all year.
My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.

Let me know

The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My "Shitty"
receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for
another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week..
Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He
will falter again.
