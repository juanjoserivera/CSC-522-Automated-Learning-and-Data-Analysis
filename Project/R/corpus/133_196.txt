FYI, I will show you how to work this spreadsheet, just call this guy and tell him what you are going to name the file and why.  Tell him it is like Brian Gillis' file in Canada.  He needs to know the prefix you are going to call the file and then you attach the current date in the MMDDYYYY format.
Thanks.
