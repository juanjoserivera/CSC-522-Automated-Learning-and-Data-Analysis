Yes, Lucinda had a little girl last Friday by c-section.  She  was about 5 
lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).  Her name is Sophia Eleni.  Then my brother 
Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.  He 
was 7 lbs, 12 oz.  Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little 
boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over 
to visit her.  We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it 
because the baby was early.

I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...?

Miss Jones,

You are always booked up.  I thought maybe you had disappeared.  Has Lucinda
had her baby?

A movie sounds good.  What did you have in mind?  Hannibal?
