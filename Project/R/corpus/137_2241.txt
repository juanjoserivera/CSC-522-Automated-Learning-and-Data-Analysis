I've answered all their questions, and have suggested to Chris that he ask 
NorthWestern for audited financials.  Marissa is preparing a letter which 
briefly outlines the deal, since GE had requested a letter identifying the 
parties, the payment obligations, etc.  I've given them all this information 
previously in phone calls and by email, but I think they want something 
official looking.  Probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter.

I don't think they will trade payment for a consent, but I could be wrong.  
It just isn't enough money, and GE isn't strapped for cash anyway.  I'd want 
to be careful that we don't trip up on E - Next obligations.

Subject: FW: Payment of GE Invoice

Kay:

I'd like to hold payment on this invoice until we receive the consent from 
GE. Any update?
