The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the 
assignment and assumption agreement.

Subject: RE: Letter agreement

Brian,
I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.
In that document, the Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade
Resources Corp. and General Electric Company, respectively.
Regards,
Jeff Smith
