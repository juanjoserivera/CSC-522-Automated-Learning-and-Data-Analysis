Dear Don,

I enjoyed your article. You are right, we are a little sensitive.  That's a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.  I must admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.  What irritates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had trouble with the law.  These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not something any husker fan is proud of.  Surely there are players in every program who have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have the sense to leave a party when asked.  My problem is that whenever a NU player messes up, it is news.  It's as if there is a Lincoln Journal Star reporter with an office in the Lincoln PD complete with scanners, just waiting for some "news" to break.  I don't think ISU or any other school has such a spotlight put on them.  College kids everywhere do such things and pay for them quietly.  I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every school.  It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stick to the event they are covering.  This all started when we were the defending and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman candidate in the backfield.  The Lawrence Phillips issue back then was news because of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.  He became the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but enough already.  Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another Lawrence Phillips.

Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.  Let me thank you for your post game article which was fair and balanced.  You are right, Most NU fans are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.   NU fans continue to wish ISU and Iowa the best.  Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams do well.  Take care.
