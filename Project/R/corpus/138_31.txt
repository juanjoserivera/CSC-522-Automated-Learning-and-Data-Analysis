Seems like HPL/AEP needs to get a transportation agreement on Oasis.  As part of the June transition ENA will not be doing any bidweek business at points other than Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthage.  Therefore even if we wanted to cover this deal (which we don't), we can't.  Let me know if there is a problem with them getting there own transportation agreement.
