We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

Best,
Jeff
