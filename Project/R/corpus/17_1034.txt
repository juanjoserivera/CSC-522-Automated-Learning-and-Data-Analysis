James will be a real sport to fly with us and then turn around!!  Maybe he would like to do some Christmas shopping!!  That is a great fare - thanks for including us as buddies!..

My hair cut appointment is on Saturday morning, the 29th, so the timing on our return on Friday the 28th is very flexible for me.  Whatever flight you think would be best for us to return on will be fine.  

I am getting the phone number for the hotel and will forward that to you.  I will also get Meagan to coordinate with Nicole on their choices on Broadway plays and then I will get tickets for us.  --Sally
