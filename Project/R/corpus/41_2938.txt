Hey.  Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite.  Does the course seem like it will be good?  Were there a million people there?  Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway.  I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  Good to see you the other night.  Take care.

Best,
Jeff
