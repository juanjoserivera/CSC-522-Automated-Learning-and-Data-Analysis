Thanks.  I'll take 12 magnums.  And please order 2 cases of Coastal zin.  I 
think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this 
weekend.  I can pay you then.  

I'm not looking to make money on the grapes.  Just looking for someone to 
finance the development of my land.  And I'd have a vineyard to look at all 
the time!  That'd be enough for me.  Thanks for all your help.

The champagne is $10 per magnum. 
Of course you can order the zin - when do you want to pick it up? 
Thank you for making me laugh a lot. 
I have asked our vineyard guy for some names and he will be getting back to 
me shortly.  He thinks the best person is probably someone from KJ who does a 
lot of stuff up there.  Should have it soon.  He was not overly encouraging 
in terms of making money!
