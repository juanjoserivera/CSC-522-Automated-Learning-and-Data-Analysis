We are ok with numbers 1 and 2 of your email with one change.  We would like to place "Associated Costs" in the "Appendix" as a defined term.

Let me know if this is acceptable and I will proceed with execution documents.  I should let you know I am currently waiting on my credit dept. regarding any changes to the numbers in the credit sections.  I hope to have an answer by tomorrow.
