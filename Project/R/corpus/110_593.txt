Joe,

We are working on the JCC project with the crude desk (Vasant
Shanbhogue and Nelson Neal are involved in the project).
We are meeting with Marc de la Roche tomorrow to present
our findings about pricing and hedging.

We shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over
the phone.

Vince

P.S. You are right. The margins are fat. It looks like a great opportunity.
