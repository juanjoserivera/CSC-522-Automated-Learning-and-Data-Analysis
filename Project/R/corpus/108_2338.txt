Jay,

I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents Stephanie forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get Fred involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from Enron Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or Ken Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.
