Sara, 

We didn't get the attachment with this one.  could you please resend.  Also, 
the first paragraph looks like this:

 Reference is made to the Master Agreement dated as of rFinancialMasterDate_ 
(the "Agreement") between rCounterpartyName_ ("Counterparty") and Enron North 
America Corp. (&ENA8), pursuant to which this Confirmation is delivered and 
to which the Transaction contemplated herein is subject.

Thanks,
Joe

Attached is revised language to drop in the confirm.  John:  Please approve.  
Joe:  edit my margins AND does the preamble of the confirm use the word 
"Agreement" to define the Master Agreement?  THIS IS NOT AN ISDA!
