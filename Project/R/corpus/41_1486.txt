Professor Tasker:

I have the distinct (and sinking) feeling that you may not be getting emails 
that I've sent to you, since over the last 3 weeks I've sent a few and 
haven't heard back.  Is the haas account the correct address?

Best,
Jeff

I did not see our names on your list.  Please see Jeff's e-mail sent to you
last Friday.  Sorry for any confusion.
Thanks,
