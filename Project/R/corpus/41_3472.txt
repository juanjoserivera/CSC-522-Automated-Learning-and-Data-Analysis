I agree.  Sue, I'm willing to join Mike in a meeting with Bilas. Mike, can you set up a meeting for Wednesday morning?  Sue: Can you meet with Brown/Gamson? Others have thoughts about these meetings?

PS  Boeing's lobbyist told Katz today (Davis' point person on 78)that the date must be September 1, period.  Katz told the Boeing lobbyist that the August 25th date is there to "screw Enron." Hedy has confirmed that Raytheon is also working the date issue.

Best,
Jeff
