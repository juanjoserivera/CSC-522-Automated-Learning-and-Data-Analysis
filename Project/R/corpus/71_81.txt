Once again you made my day. You are really a wonderful person, you know?

Don't worry I'm not falling off a cliff - you will hear from me again.  Also 
I'll give you a call before I get out of here next week.

Lots of love,

Rob

Subject: RE: Happy Valentine's Day


thanks for the very sweet message.  You can never be more delinquent than i
since i only mailed your b-day gift a few days ago.  There is nothing worse
than trying to find a gift for a married retiring millionaire. Hence, the
weird gift combination - but i was thinking fishing. Work continues to be
stressfully busy because i'm preparing for a number of trials.  I'm going to
go to Vegas next week anyway bc i need a break.  Thanks for thinking of me -
I'm doing fine. The only time i cried recently was at my arbitration hearing
yesterday - my client's testimony was so touching that i cried (how
embarassing!) - hate when that happens!  It's not the 1st time & i'm sure
not the last.  I know you are very busy during these last few weeks and am
touched that you even had time to think of me.  I thought about you too on
V-day & should have done something special since it probably will not be
possible again. Ok, stop rolling your eyes - you think i'm a flake.  That's
one of the greatest things about you - you are never flaky.  lots of love,
sue
