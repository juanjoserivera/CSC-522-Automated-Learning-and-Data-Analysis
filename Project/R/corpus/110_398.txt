Steve,

Shirley  sent you the info about the dinner,  in case you can arrive in time
to join us on Sunday evening. Please, let me know, so that
I can adjust the reservation at the restaurant. 

Bob Lee may be out (a possible operation).

You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail address: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home
(281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting
you on Sunday or Monday. 

Vince
