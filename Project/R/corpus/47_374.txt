Tracy, as Stephanie mentioned in her e-mail to you, all of next Tuesday morning through early afternoon is consumed by the Enron Board of Directors meeting and by the Annual Shareholders meeting.  Following my duties in connection with those meetings, I will be departing for San Antonio.  Perhaps Mark and I could talk by telephone this week or visit in San Antonio next week.  Thank you.  Jim Derrick
