I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions.

Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?

Scott, I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ?flash? maybe and trying to correct a few things.  I'm not sure what the process is now.  Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items?

By the way team, Scott is out till next week.
