Kate,
It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times. Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it. We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.
I appreciate your understanding.

Bill
