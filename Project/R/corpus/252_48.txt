Alan,

I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials)
2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as " Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver"
	Why is there no obligation to deliver?
3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?

Thanks for the help.

Bill
