Paolo,

I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get
a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that
I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension 
.pdf  and begin with teh same string of characters.
Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.


My fax number is 713 646  2503.

Vince
