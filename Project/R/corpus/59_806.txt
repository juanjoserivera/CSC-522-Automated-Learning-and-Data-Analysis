Matt, 

Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to 
get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a 
month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I 
have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When 
the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on 
Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very 
important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming 
this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the 
range.

Darren,
Do you know if you were running pulling up the Path Manager for a date range 
around 10:51?; How do you normally pull up the Path Manager?; Please let me 
know as we're attempting to find out what caused this problem and if we 
should restrict access on the date range functionality.; If you were only 
pulling it for a day, that would be okay.
;
Thanks
