I used this option at Craig today for Monday.  I am leaving the office today early and have not yet input the deal as we are waiting to put it into the Rockies book.  The schedule for 10/8/01 is as follows:

HE 11 - 10mws
HE 12-14  -  25mws

That is it.  We are currently out by this amount at Craig in the postion manager.  Let Tom or Mark know if you have any questions, or call me.

Thank You,
Holden
