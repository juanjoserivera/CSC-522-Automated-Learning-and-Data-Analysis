Is the invite only party? I have not received a personal invitation.... and
this one is usually hard to crash. I'm putting my list together of all the
parties. I talked to Victor... he said I could stop by the floor and train
with you for about on hour... you're such a sweetie!!! Seriously... Victor
said I could stop by and see everyone... since PG&E is not a threat to
y'all. I'll either do it Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.
