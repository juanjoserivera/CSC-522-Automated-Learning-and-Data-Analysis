Sheridan,

I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call 
about this. I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation 
study we discussed at San Antonio. Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on
to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study.
Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making
inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area,
regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we
already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount
rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential
values.

It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling. It would
also help if you could write a formal letter to him.
