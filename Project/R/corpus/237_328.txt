Todd, further to your voice message. Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday. He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.
