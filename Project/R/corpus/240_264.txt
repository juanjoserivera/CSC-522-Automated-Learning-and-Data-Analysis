Don,

Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager
West Gas Origination
