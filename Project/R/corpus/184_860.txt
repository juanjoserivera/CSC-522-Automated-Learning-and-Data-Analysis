thanks susan for the update.  when you talk to cathy see if we can get a draft anytime today/tonight - the only chance I will likely have to review it will be Wed morning, very early (around 4 or 5 am).  They can email it me directly and I can pick it up at my house in the am if necessary.  My email is Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com
