eze:  its at 7:30 and its usually $20.  all the money gets spent on the wine, so its a good deal.  its extremely casual and it would be great to see jill again. as for jamie, brokering is a slimy business and its hard to see how she fits in, but then i don't know her that well.  didn't see royal t's... i went home and went to bed (i'm sick! yuck).  dorland is chris dorland and a guy i sit next to at work.  he was there on saturday night.  i'm sure you'll run into him again.  i'll let craig know you are thinking of coming.
