Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted
