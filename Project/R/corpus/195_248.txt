here's the deal on the arm:

just got bk from france late mon night- had
lots of fun, race was ok, but looooong.  triped on harry potter's cape and
had to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the
finish line.  quel surpris- sustain injury to my arm while running a
marathon.  

as for tomorrow...talked to Em this morning and she's on her way to NB to meet with the tile people.  said she'd be back either late tonight or early tomorrow morning.  as for tomorrow night, she's waiting to see about grandparents, etc. but may be able to meet if it's early....she's supposed to give me a call later so i'll let her know about the colina's thing
