Hi 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases.
ps Boston was great, thanks
