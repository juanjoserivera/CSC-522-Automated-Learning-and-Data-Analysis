There are rumors around here that all the employees going to the new company - UBS Energy will be taken off of the Enron servers tomorrow.  If this is true, I do not know what or when my email service at work will be back up.  Please send in the mean time any emails to plove@houston.rr.com.  Thanks.  Hope all of you are doing well.
