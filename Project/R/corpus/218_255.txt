Steve,
	I don't see the attachment. As far as the percentage of Calf. contracts that have  band consumption, my assumption is that it is quite high. I base this on our discussion w/ Dennis and my talks w/ Neil Bresnen. My understanding is that all contracts that where written after first quarter of 1999, have some type of  band consumption language in them.  I spoke w/ Joshua yesterday and I feel that we are making the progress that I would expect at this point. I would like to meet w/ you when I get back in Houston on Monday if you have the time. Also, Joshua is supposed to send me an update today so that I can better assess as to where we are at on the consumption band initiative.

			PS. Sorry I am late getting back w/ you, I could get into my e-mail yesterday but could not send out any e-mail. I still owe you the Project Phoenix   			       list. Also, do we still need to meet w/ Kristian and Murray?
