Mr. Stewart, as per your voice mail request on Feb. 20, 2001, attached find 
the correspondance relating to the request of replacing the existing mixing 
valves with carburetors at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.  In 
this discussion, Jon Fields of Argent Consulting was involved.  I have 
attached for your review the letter requests from Northern to you and the 
e-mails which were traded back and forth from yourself and Argent.  The 
results of the pre testing emissions with the mixing valves on and the post 
testing of the emissions with the carburetors on were mailed to you on Jan. 
20, 2001.  The testing results were compiled in hard copy form and are not 
included with this submittal, but can be resubmitted if requested.  Your 
favorable request in this replacement activity is requested.
