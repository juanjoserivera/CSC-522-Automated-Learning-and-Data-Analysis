Duran is fine. I had it in my mind that Calger had signed the incumbancy 
cert.  My mistake.

I'm trying to set up a closing table and have these guys sign this am before 
I lose them.

Subject: RE: escrow instruction

Kay:

The person signing the escrow instruction must be someone who is listed on
the incumbency certificate that we previously submitted to Citibank (i.e.,
Thomas or Duran).  Can we change the signatory to Duran as opposed to
Calger?

(I suppose we have the same issue with PPL, as Vicens is not named on PPL's
incumbency certificate and Citibank already raised that issue for them on
the escrow agreement.  I will let Greg Lang know.)
