Shannon,

I sent Joe Hunter an e-mail aking why this deal wasn't being settled (I 
copied you on it).  The only other deal I see in the system for City of 
Huntsville is NF8497.1.  It is a Flex Price deal for the same term as the 
deal mentioned below.  I'll call when Joe lets me know something.

Thanks,

Errol
