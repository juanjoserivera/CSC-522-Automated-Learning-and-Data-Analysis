Thanks.  Of the two - I think UBS is better.  It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.  It should be good.  Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.
 
We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.  The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night). We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?
 
Let me know.
 
-Eric
