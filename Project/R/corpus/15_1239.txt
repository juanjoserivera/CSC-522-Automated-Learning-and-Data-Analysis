hey brian,
the holidays were good.  it wasn't really that big of a break for me b/c we are still doing nothing at work.  how were your's? and how is the job search going?
i am still trying to figure out the payouts for the league.  i think that you get 25% of the pot for 2nd place.
the tigers' future looks pretty bright - esp with spurrier gone now.  how do you think they will be next year?
 
 
oh well, i hope things are going well.  lets try to get together for drinks sometime soon.
 
-eric
