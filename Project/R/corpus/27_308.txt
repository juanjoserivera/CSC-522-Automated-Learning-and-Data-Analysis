David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so the allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to come. Rick
