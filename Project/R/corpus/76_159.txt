Yes.  I talked to Carlos yesterday so I'm pretty sure he is too.  I'm just waiting on the fallout from the UBS purchase of my organization.  It is supposed to be in front of the bankruptcy court today.  I'll let you know.

Carley has learned to ride her bike.  She is pretty excited about it.  We will come see you this weekend.
