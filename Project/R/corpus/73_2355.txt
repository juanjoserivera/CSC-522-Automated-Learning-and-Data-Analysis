I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?
