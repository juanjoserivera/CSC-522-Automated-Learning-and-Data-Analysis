Hi,

Yesterday Richter asked me to get with John Oh and bring him up to speed on everything that we use.  Although I think this is a good idea, I think that this direction should more appropriately come from you.

Please let me know what you would like me to do, if it would be beneficial to have me explain our stuff to both John and Victor, I will be happy to do so.


Thanks,

C
