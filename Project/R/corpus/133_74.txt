Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful he has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led the nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He has three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might be a real good move.  How are things there?
