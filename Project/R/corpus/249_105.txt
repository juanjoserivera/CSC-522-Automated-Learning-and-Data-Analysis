I ran deal data for the counterparties we received termination notification on today.  I did not want to start moving deals while you were running calcs, so we can just do this tomorrow.  The deals are on the 'East New as of 12-19' and the 'West New as of 12-19' tabs.

P.S. Don't forget about Will's new application in stage.
