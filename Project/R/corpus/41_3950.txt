The pleasure was all mine.  You did a fantastic job with the presentation (both developing and presenting it).  Likewise, it lifted my spirits in these challenging times to meet someone as talented (and fun!) as you.  Hope our paths cross again often.  Never hesitate to get in touch if there's anything I can do.

Best,
Jeff
