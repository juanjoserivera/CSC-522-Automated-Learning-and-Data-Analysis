Sounds reasonable.  Let me know what time you can meet this weekend.  After noon on Saturday, and  anytime before 4 pm on Sunday works great for me.

Understanding that it's a T&M job, would you nonetheless be able to give a ballpark figure once we've spoken this weekend and you've had a chance to think about it?

Also, I've got some longer range plans (barn, house, etc.) for the property that I'd like to run by you, too, but that's longer off.  Really want to get the deck done before the rain starts.

Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
