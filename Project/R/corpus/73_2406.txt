Hey there.  I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment.  Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make.  I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet.

thanks.
