looks like Florida will not be very good next year.  They are losing their best players to the draft.  All three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today.  Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.  Shanahan just turned it down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.  See what happens.  Did you get your pool cover fixed?
