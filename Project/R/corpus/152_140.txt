Good afternoon,


Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impression was that Rev. Jackson was resigning.  I called Horace this morning and asked him if he resigned and he said, Oh no, he had just made a mistake (I get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him out on him, and Horace being the good, honest person that he is, couldn't lie).  He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church.  Robin said he was just crying while he was talking.  He said he's in "time out" now.  I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in "time out" but he kind of kept talking.  He said he's really having family problems surrounding this church thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks.  He won't be in the pulpit, he said Gregg would probably have him sitting with the deacons.  I asked him what is going on with the deacons,  and he said it would take all day to talk about that, and he had someone in his office.  I let him go after that.  Now isn't all of that interesting.   

I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday.  She married Tyrone this past Sunday.  

That revival is this week isn't it?

Talk with you later!
