How is it going?  I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relating to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I think it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved.  Below is a quick dialog that Greg Johnston and I have had with respect to the cuts and what we can and can not do.

This seems to be blown way out of proportion by Kevin Heal and if there is anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.

Thanks,

Jon
