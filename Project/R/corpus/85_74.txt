I wished to review the filing (especially the TOA) and comment along the 
lines we have before.  Unfortunately, I did not have time to read the filing 
before leaving for vacation.  I left the filing on my desk.  Hope you had a 
happy holiday.  I don't know if Lysa told you but my mother in law died the 
day before Christmas so I will be taking off Jan. 4 & 5th to attend the 
memorial on the East Coast.  I'll be checking my E-mails periodically.

Subject: RTO West

I have not read the filings summarized below.

I am assuming we will not be protesting/intervening but will be focusing on 
Phase II.  Any thoughts otherwise?
