Peter:
 
    Attached is as Assignment Agreement that Tenaska Marketing Canada would like to enter to move certain November ENA trades to ECC.  Frankly, this ultimately becomes a payables issue as most of the deliveries have been completed.  I have approved the document and am forwarding it on to credit to handle getting the signatures.  I would appreciate it if you could expedite this when it gets to you.
 
Thanks, 
 
Jeff
