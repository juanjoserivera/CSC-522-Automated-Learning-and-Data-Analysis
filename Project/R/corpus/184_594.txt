My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Clyde's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But in the meanwhile a preview.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  taking credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too painful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others can begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet another name for himself.
