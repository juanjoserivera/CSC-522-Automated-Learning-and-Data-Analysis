Company policy (and corporate organizational documents) dictates that ALL 
contracts may only be executed by an officer at the Vice President level or 
above.  I checked the Corporate Secretary's Records and they indicate that 
neither Beth Perlman nor Richard Burchfield meet such requirements for Enron 
Net Works.  Mark Greenberg directed me to get the agreement executed by 
Phillippe Bibi.  Other officers we frequently get Networks agreements 
executed by are David Berberian, Managing Director, Greg Piper, Managing 
Director and Chief Operating Officer, Rex Shelby, Managing Director, or Andy 
Zipper, Vice President.  If it relates to Commodity Logic, we can go to Tom 
Gros, Vice President.  Feel free to approach any of this slate of officers to 
get your documents executed.

Hi, Tana.  I,d prefer to work this at a lower level if possible.  Could we 
get either Richard Burchfield or Beth Perlman to sign the MOU?
