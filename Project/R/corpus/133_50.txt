thanks for the file.  I am attaching the basis curves we have set up and the GDY curve file as well.  I am finishing the physical as we speak.  Please look at these three files and let me know if you would like any changes.  We are only putting the published curves in the files, at least to begin with.  West Basis is the rockies at southwest curves and CA basis is the california markets.  Thanks.
