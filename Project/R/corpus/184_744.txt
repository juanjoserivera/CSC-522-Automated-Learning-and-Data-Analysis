Oh no.  In the meanwhile,

Ella learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms Jane help her learn and she put me to shame.

Sam misses you.

I want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?

I miss you.

I signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.  Do you want me to sign you up?

Everybody is fine.
