Greg,

Listed below is a brief outline of some of the key items that I turned over 
to McMahon.  I didn't attempt to put down anything but a reference point but 
he has the files and we went through every point.  We didn't spend a lot of 
time on the international activities because a great deal of it might not be 
part of the group after project Summer.  He attended my (his) Monday staff 
meeting and he got a flavor of the group and what everyone does.  This is 
going to be primarily Philippe's meeting now but he is going to attend to 
provide needed commercial balance and if he does, I believe that is all the 
time he has to spend on that side of the business.

I hope you are having a successful trip.

Mike
