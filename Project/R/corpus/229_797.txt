Yes - and boats.  I wasn't too worried until the last update which indicates 
the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there - just 
barely east of due south of the BVI.  They are predicting that it will resume 
its course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.  As of 
the middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the Friday 
charter starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's!

AA is fine - St Thomas.  All we need to do now is make sure there are
islands left to fly into.

Thanks,
