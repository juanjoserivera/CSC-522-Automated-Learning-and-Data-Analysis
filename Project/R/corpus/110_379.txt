Alex,

Thanks a lot. I could open our resume.
We hire part-time employees to help
us with our weather effort: the work is
concentrated in the early morning hours
6:00 to 10:00 a.m.

I shall check with Mike Roberts who runs the group
about our needs.

Please, let me know if you are interested in
a summer internship in 2002. The decisions
are made in late January and February and 
you should let me know by then.

Vince
