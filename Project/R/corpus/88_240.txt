Aparna:

Regarding your e-mail asking us to prepare a confidentiality agreement, below is an e-mail from Tana Jones forwarding two forms of CAs to Credit so that you all can prepare your CAs requesting financials without having to ask Legal to prepare it.  The CA must be initialed by a lawyer prior to signing by either Bill or Rick, and a copy of the fully executed CA must be sent to Kay Young in Legal.  Let us know if you have any questions.
