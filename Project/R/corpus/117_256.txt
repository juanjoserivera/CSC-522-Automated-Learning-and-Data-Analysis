Scott,
 
I did the last four pages of this.  The pages before that look like they have already been done.  I just spot checked most of them but the entire first page was done already.  I didn't want to waste time, Bridgette is out until next year so I couldn't ask her what the problem is.  I'll leave the pages on your desk.
