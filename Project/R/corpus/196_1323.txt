I think an original tasters gathering is a great idea...unfortunately, I'm 
going to be out of town Thursday (I'm visiting my friend Emily in London and 
I have to admit I am very excited).  If you guys do end up going have a great 
time.

Ashlea is right, it was amazing.  It looked like a really fun crowd.  I hope
that everyone can be there.
