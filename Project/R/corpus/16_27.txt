Hey,

I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting, from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had your email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.

We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!


So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab  supper some time. 

Take care,

Don
