Hey Tim,

not sure what you guys are up to, likely making yourself pretty for potential investors?  

we're not quite at that point yet here, so things are very slow which has given me some
time to look into R (been on my list for quite some time).  It looks very good!  have you
had a chance to look into it?  i'd like to verify that it's worth putting some time into.  

hope things are going well and i'll give a call to chat sometime soon.
