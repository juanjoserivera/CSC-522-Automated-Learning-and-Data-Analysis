Chris, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?  It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term. ( winter Gas).  You would think that they would be fine with loading up on Enron. Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!! 

With regards to a meeting.... I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. 

I think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal.  I will call you today.
