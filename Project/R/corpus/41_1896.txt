I'll be there about ten after 12.  Here are some minor comments I have on the 
presentation.  I'm going to try to go thru the rest and give any final 
comments by 8 PM tonite.  Or maybe we can do that over lunch.

Best,
Jeff

Coke,s acquisition of Quaker Oats:  Why did it fizzle?

 In November 2000, Coke offered to purchase Quaker Oats for $15.75 billion
