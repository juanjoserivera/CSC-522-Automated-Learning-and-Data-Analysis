Karen,
I have spoken with Adrianne yesterday concerning the status of this process.    At that time,   I had left messages with all three candidates,  but was unable to reach them.
Late yesterday afternoon,  I received a call from Nicholas Watson.   
I was impressed with his previous experience in trading and his educational background.    He also had shown some innovation related to some projects that he worked on at JP Morgan Chase & Co.

I would recommend scheduling Nicholas for an interview.   I did relay to him that we would contact him within a week.

I will again call the other candidates.
