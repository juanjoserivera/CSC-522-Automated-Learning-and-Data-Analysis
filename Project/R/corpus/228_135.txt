Mr. Nimocks,

I don't know if you have spoken w/Greg as of yet.  However, I do know he is 
trying very hard to work this into his schedule.  I'll get w/him again 
tomorrow morning for an answer.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley

Greg,
Certainly hope you can join us for the keynote session to describe one
year's experience with EOL and what's in store next.  Tim Ling, chairman of
TradeRanger -- the fourteen-company procurement consortium with BP Amoco,
Shell, Unocal, Total Fina and others -- has confirmed.  Still working with
the others.
Bob
