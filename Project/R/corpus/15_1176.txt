i think things will be ok at enron.  it is pretty depressing right now though.  how is school for you?

just to let you know - i got seats on the 40 yd line for the game.  right now it is going to be  me, you, matt lenhart, and my dad.  i will be out of the office next tuesday and wednesday.  so give me call at work before then or you can call me on my cell (713)-628-3104 or at home (713)661-2601.
