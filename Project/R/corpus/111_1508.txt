Dale,

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving 
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case. 

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

Vince:

I will call tomorrow in the morning.  Lunch or right after lunch would be
great.  How would 100 pm work for you?
