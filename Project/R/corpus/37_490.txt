Mr. Chad is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.

I'll have my cell phone with me too.  We will be back on Fri. Mar 15.

Please look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion:  April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.

FYI - Alina had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.  She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.

I've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility).
