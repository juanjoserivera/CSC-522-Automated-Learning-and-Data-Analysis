Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the Atlantic.

I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I think that's why they can't dock in ny.

Has Amanda made it back yet?
