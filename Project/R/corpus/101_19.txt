Geoff:

Attached is J.Aron's request and their exposure to Enron.  Rita has not already found a suitable offset as she felt it was most appropriate to get our permission first.  PLease make go away.

Also, I received a similar request from David Dutch at Entergy-Koch.  Please call him at 713-544-5580.  Make this go away too.

Finally, find paper I put on your desk from Harrison wtih Sempra.

Have fun Sweet Pea!!!
