hey - thanks for getting back anyway -- i thought it went pretty well - he said -- let's keep talking -- kevin masek was there too - i stayed for a drink with him after randy left and he thought it went really well.  i had a good time -- seemed like he was trying to be pretty formal though.  i was pretty excited with what he had to say about their plans and i know i would get along well with the people that are there so far.  and, i think i can bring alot to the table for him.  we'll see what happens.  i know he'll tell you everything :).
