Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing, which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!
