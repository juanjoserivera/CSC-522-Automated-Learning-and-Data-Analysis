What's football withdrawal?  

Howzabout we invite the pool to the napa golf course (everyone pays their own 
way) and have a scramble, or something?  It would be a lot of fun and it 
would give Scott and Cameron another thing to win and gloat over (that's 
right Eldon, they're gloaters---shame on them).

I think its more fun to have a game on that people can watch if they want to 
and cheer.? It,s also still football season so most people are happy and not 
in football withdrawal.
