Paul,
 
I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmed
that he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did not
receive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue.
 
I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.
He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers
who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal 
relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.
 
My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his social
intelligence.
 
 
Vince
