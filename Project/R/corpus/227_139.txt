A spoon is a good start.  I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?  In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on.
