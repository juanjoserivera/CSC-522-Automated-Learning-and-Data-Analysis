Tell them that margin will be posted as normal, no excess nor any intraday calls.  Since ENE is flush with liquidity, he should be very comfortable that we can pay our bills.  The positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of Man and close the account.  Anything different and all dealings between Man and Enron in energy will be terminated in both OTC and futures.
