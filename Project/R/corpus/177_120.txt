its going well, thanks for asking - work is good - i'm getting excited to start trading again and i'm actually doing some real work!  feels good.  and i'm having fun with the whole exercise thing - i hope it sticks.  how are things with you - i know you are super busy, but it must be good to finally be starting a career?  

rockne is a special treat.  at least he isn't hairy.  i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life.  

i'm not excited to move at all, but i am looking forward to living in a new spot.  change is good.  i probly won't need your help moving, but i am planning on lifting some of those shelves from ikea, so i'll be sure to give you a ring for the install.  

great to see you last night at banana.  i can't wait to wear my blue pants, but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule, so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day.  definitely a good purchase, since i'll probably wear them twice (total).  

hope to see you tonight.
