No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

Best,
Jeff
