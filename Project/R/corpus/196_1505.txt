"For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real 
life. But there was always some
obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished 
business, time still to be served, 
or a debt to be paid.  Then life would begin.  At last it dawned on me that 
these obstacles WERE my "life."
            
So, treasure every moment that you have...and remember that time waits for no 
one...

So stop waiting

                                                until you finish school,

                                              until you go back to school,

                                               until you lose ten pounds,

                                               until you gain ten pounds,

                                                  until you have kids,

                                            until your kids leave the house,

                                                 until you start work,

                                                    until you retire,

                                                 until you get married,

                                                until you get divorced,

                                                   until Friday night,

                                                 until Sunday morning,

                                            until you get a new car or home,

                                           until your car or home is paid off,

                                                     until spring,

                                                    until summer,

                                                       until fall,

                                                     until winter,

                                               until you are off welfare,

                                               until the first or fifteenth,

                                               until your song comes on,

                                                until you've had a drink,

                                                until you've sobered up,

                                                     until you die,

                                                until you are born again

                             to decide that there is no better time than 
right now to be happy(

                                        Happiness is a journey, not a 
destination.
