I am sorry I am just getting back to you, but I had to check with my whole 
legal team around the world, and I just heard back from the final critical 
one.  We are OK with them trading the products below.  However, on physical 
power, they can only trade west power.  Stephanie, will you need to open them 
up so they can trade immediately?

Lisa/Stephanie, could you please ensure that the trading profiles for each of 
the three PG&E entities are changed below such that by tomorrow morning they 
will be able to transact once we restore their headroom once we enter it into 
the system?

Tana, are you OK with restoring the changes reflected below?  I'm thinking 
that since they had this transact ability once before, that it should be OK.  

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANY PROBLEMS.  

Thanks all!

Walter
