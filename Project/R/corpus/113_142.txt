I know Bob from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.  I told Bob that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).  I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ... but if you hear of someone looking, please pass Bob's resume along.
