Jim- J Block was just a gas contract. At Enron, risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doesn't fit into a book.
