Lisa --

I appreciate your note greatly.  While we didn't always win, we did always give the other side the fight of their lives.  Electricity markets in the Mid-atlantic (and throughout the country) are better for the work you did over the last few years.  

Best of luck in your future plans.  I'm sure that we will talk again, and often.

Take care,

Jim
