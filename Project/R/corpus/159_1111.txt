You are very welcome!  I enjoyed it.

 Thanks for the name of the city.  We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so 
we'll try to check it out.  Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be 
interesting?  Probably won't be able to find turkey, dressing, or american 
football anywhere.   Any fun plans for the Thanksgiving holiday?
