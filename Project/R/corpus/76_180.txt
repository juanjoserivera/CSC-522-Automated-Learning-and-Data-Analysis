It's good to hear from you.  The game is November 10th.  And we hope you come down, it would be alot of fun.  We are getting ready to go to Disney World on Saturday.  The kids are pumped.  First I guess you should see if I'm the coverage area.  We are at:

14343 Millstone Estates Ln.
Cypress, TX  77429
281-304-8303

Right now, we just have dial-up internet service and a local calling company that also gives us 100 minutes of long-distance.  We get off pretty cheap on this, but I would be willing to give this ION a try.  Let me know.
