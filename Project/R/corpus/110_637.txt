Hello Darrell,

Many changes in Enron kept me busy during  the last few days.

Rabi and Tanya are working on a new version of the documentation
and we hope to send it to you in a few days.

I agree with you that the document we sent you was rather cryptic
and apologize for not screening it more effectively.
I agree with you regarding point # 2 and so does Tanya. I think
she did not explain precisely what she meant by her comment.

I hope to talk to you soon.

Vince


P.S. We still owe you money for work done over the last 18 months.
