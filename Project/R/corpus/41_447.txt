While Leslie was out I had a brief discussion with Tycholiz, et al.  They're 
going to pull together an outline of the things they're thinking about and 
get back to us on it for discussion.

Best,
Jeff

Leslie--I don't know whatever happened to this discussion?  I suggested to 
Jeff that I would be available off and on during the week, but I think he was 
nuts with the legislative session.  SHould we try again or have you already 
discussed?
