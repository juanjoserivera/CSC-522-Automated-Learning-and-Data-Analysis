Mirant had a problem with an EOL transaction where I bought 5,000 from then at $5.10 for the 1st and 2nd.  I agreed to let them out of the deal.  Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.  The two deals should be netted.  We should not have paid the purchase at 5.10.
