Change in plans - Patti will send slides for both me and Beth.  She is formating info from Beth's assistant into format that I used for my slides, so you will get these as one presentation.  (Patti has already sent my slides so that you can begin the process of making copies for the binders.)  I think that you already have slides from Tom on CommodityLogic.  We are working on a few slides for the Commercialization Effort - will have those ready as soon as we can.   Thanks, Tina. --Sally
