Subject:	South Central Team

The South Central team would like to update you regarding our current status with Ruthe and Jamie's departures:

We understand you will be visiting with us regarding the changes within our team with Ruthe and Jamie's departures.  With Ruthe and Jamie's resignations, our team is now comprised of nine schedulers and two accountants.  We are interested in learning if we will be allowed to fill at least one position.  Ruthe has been such a valued team member and will be sorely missed -- not only for her expertise in allocations and scheduling, but in her participation in holiday/weekend coverage.  Jamie's participation in the holiday/weekend coverage will also be missed.  Of course, their daily presence in handling the telephone calls and participation in team responsibilities are also missed.  Since our team rotates the evening position in order to distribute that responsibility throughout the nine schedulers,  we will miss Ruthe and Jamie's participation in that as well -- this amounts to approximately five weeks annually each.  With the reassignment of their evenings along with holiday/weekend coverage, we are basically looking at a rotation of once every third weekend.

In the interim, we understand Randy has provided a list to you with the suggested reassignments of Ruthe and Jamie's accounts.

We are hopeful we will be allowed to fill this position on our team and we look forward to visiting with you.

Thank you,
South Central
