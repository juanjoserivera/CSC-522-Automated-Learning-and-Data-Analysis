Steve:

I have now heard back from both Louise and Andy and neither one will be 
available.  Unfortunately, Mark has now left again and I am on my way out on 
vacation for a couple of weeks.  It might make sense for you to contact Mark 
directly since you will be able to get to him before I can.

Sorry about that.

Mark

Mark, 

Just wanted to mention to you that if either Louise Kitchens, Andy Zipper or 
Mark Haedicke are interested in participating in the Energy Bar program but 
is not yet in a position to make a firm commitment, we can list the speaker 
as "invited" for the first mailing and then make any corrections that are 
necessary on a subsequent mailing that will be distributed.? Of course, the 
Bar Association would not list a speaker as "invited" without prior 
authorization.? Would it be possible to get back to me today on an 
EnronOnline speaker?? Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule 
to provide assistance.

Steve
