I heard from the Keltings....that would love to have dinner on Sunday. Sorry
we could not make the Rodeo. That would have been fun. Do we need to make
reservations at Lucinda's? What time shall we go? Jake got on Barry Loder's
soccer team. It was a strange deal. I will tell you about it Sunday or give
me a call when you get a chance.
