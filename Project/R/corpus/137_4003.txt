Sounds good.

We went to Palacios last weekend.  The water was very silty from the rain, 
and the tide was low.  There were a few black drum, but not much else.  We 
did find a stone crab, which was a first.

Kay,

I have a conflict Wed afternoon.  But can catch up on Thurs with you and
Kent.

Meanwhile, please send me an e-copy of the LM Exhibits.  I can do a quick
redline of those that change.  I've already marked up w/ red pen, the ESA
Electrobolt + the Summary of terms sheet (ala Dale's on LV II).

Thanks,

Lee
