John,

My suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: Austin, San Antonio or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. Pete) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.

I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.

Tom
