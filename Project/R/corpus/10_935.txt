Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.
