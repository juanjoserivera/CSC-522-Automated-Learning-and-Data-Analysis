Walt, the East Lake proposal sounds great IF it fits into your schedule.  I plan to return to Houston either Wednesday morning or Wednesday afternoon, depending on whether we do or do not play East Lake.  Please do not reschedule any meetings you have just to enable us to play Wednesday morning-- Austusta will certainly have been excitement enough.  I am leaving Houston tomorrow morning and will not be able to check e-mail after this afternoon, so if you need to reach me drop me a voice mail at 713-853-5550. All the best.  Jim
