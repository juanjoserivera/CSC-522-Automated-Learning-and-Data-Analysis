I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.

Subject: RE: GE Turbines

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.
