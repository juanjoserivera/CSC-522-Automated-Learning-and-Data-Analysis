Hey,

I may swing by the Tasters dinner just to say, "Hi" to everyone and then meet you at the Forest Club.  What do you think of that?  Also, Katy and I may go to Blanco's later if you and Leslie have any interest.

So I've decided I will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys.  I'm sick of these crappy ones.

Sue
