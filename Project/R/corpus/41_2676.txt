		 Subject: RE: Meet

I agree that we need to get together.  I am going to grind out a spreadsheet
tomorrow night.  Unfortunately, my friends birthday dinner is Thursday
night.  I know Ted is going to be gone for the weekend.

Can we get together tomorrow or over the weekend without Ted?  Ted is going
to do some research on the discount rate, which can be dropped in to any
analysis that we come up with.

What do you think?
