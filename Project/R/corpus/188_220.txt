Sorry about the conference call this morning--- I neglected to get a call in number. I talked to Paul Simon, who had talked to Limor Nissan, and among the lawyers, we have no more comments. Paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues. Paul will contact you today with these changes/additions. If they are not substantive, I don't need to see them. Send Limor, Paul, and me a copy of the filed pleading. Thanks for your help.
