i've been playing around more with R (doing some reading and installing the basic package) and it looks fantastic.  in particular, the database connecticity package ("RODBC") works right out of the box!  very impressive.  in a couple of lines, i can get data from a table in a SQL server database into a dataframe and more importantly, result sets from stored procedures can be returned to data frames as well.  and its free!
