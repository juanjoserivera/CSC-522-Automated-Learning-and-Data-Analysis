While I, too, am frustrated at how things turned out, I'm glad your content 
overall with the course.  Definitely one of the best--if not THE 
best--classes I've taken.  I really think that we need to get together 
tomorrow nite to finalize, but I don't feel like pushing it too much.  Your 
thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Apology not necessary!  However, you are very kind to consider my
perspective on the group and project.  I am certainly a bit frustrated with
how this project is turning out.  We should have "white boarded" our ideas
and reached consensus in the very beginning I think.  It would have saved
all of us time.  I'm counting on Mark to drive this home for us smoothly.

But, at the end of the day, I am pleased with how much I learned in Tasker's
class, which is the ultimate point anyway.
