Correct.  If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the 
timing restriction.  You lose one layer of optionality.

So if we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext the entire project 
goes on the balance sheet since we will be committed to building a road and 
stormwater system.  There we all must be aware that we can not close on the 
property until the LLC is owned by ENext.  Do you agree?
