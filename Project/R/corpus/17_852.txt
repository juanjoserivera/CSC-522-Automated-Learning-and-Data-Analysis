Our meeting with EIM is set for Monday, October 12th from 9:00 to 10:30.  Ray Bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with Kevin Sweeney - Ray just initiated that meeting himself with Kevin one day last week, spur of the moment.  But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken place.  I have been working with Kent Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week to arrange our meeting now set for Monday.  

I think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.  --Sally
