The agreements haven't been executed, so please revise.  Could you also set 
me up a stand alone release, so that I can replace the release GE submitted 
on some of the other turbines?

Thanks,

Kay

Will do.  I'll make the change in the remaining agreements.  Do you want
the revised form to be included in the Fountain Valley GE and ABB
Agreements (execution copies of which went out yesterday) or have those
agreements already been executed?
