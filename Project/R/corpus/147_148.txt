Jeff,

Good to hear from you.  Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.  Enron keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.  It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.  Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.  Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.  I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.  Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.

Anyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.  I have gone to a couple of college football games.  I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.  Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.   I also went to the Grand Prix of Houston.  That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.  The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.  The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.  Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.  Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.  You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.

Trading has been hard.  I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.  But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light. 

I hope everything is going well for you.  Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.  Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.  Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.

Regards,

Jon
