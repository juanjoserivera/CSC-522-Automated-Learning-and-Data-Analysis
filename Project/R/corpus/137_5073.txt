Neil,  I thought you were going to tell her to just answer that he gets 
nothing at school.  She has no independent information on the rest and 
shouldn't worry about providing that info to them.

Subject: RE: Michael's Performance Form

I was out of the office yesterday and apologize for the delay in responding.
I'm not sure about class/type. Michael does see Sharon Seals and Associates
Speech-Language Pathologists once a week for 1 hour. The only testing has
been from Danny Williamson, Developmental Pediatrician who is an associate
of Nancy LaFever. This was an eval for ADHD. He was also tested by SBISD for
the same issue. Williamson and LaFever have all this information in his
file.
Thanks for you help with this. Neil
