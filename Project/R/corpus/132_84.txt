Our plans are to continue to use Jeanette as long as we are authorized to do so.  We recently sent a justification for keeping her indefinitely, but, as yet, have not heard anything back.  I can not give an end date because I have no plans to end the arrangement.  If we are forced to terminate this arrangement with Jeanette, we would have to add at least 1 full time position and the quality of our service would suffer greatly.  Please advise Rob Kilmer and myself of the steps we need to take to continue to use Jeanette indefinitely.  Her assignment is not related to a specific project but is to provide ongoing regulatory support to the Transwestern pipeline.
