Mike:
Can you give me an update on where things stand with you and your review of 
the docs that we sent to you?  I will be going on maternity leave shortly and 
just want to get an idea of how far along can get this before I leave.  
Thanks.i

Carol:

Why don't you go ahead and send over your CSA form?  I think the idea here
is to have it fully negotiated in advance.  As to the idea of just using
S&P, I will pass that along to our Treasury Dept.
