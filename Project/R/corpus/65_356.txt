In this case,    Ercot Asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance.   The enpower deals listed below are under this desk.
The financial swap info is going out,  Frontera being the most logical first customer.

Is there anything else from us that you would want?   Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera,  etc.

Let me know what you think.
