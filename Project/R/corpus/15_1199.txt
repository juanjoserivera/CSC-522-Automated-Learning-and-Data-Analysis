as we talked about yesterday, i am still at enron.  while i have a job, i am trading natural gas futures and other derivative instruments.  i am living off of newcastle and 59 in the Gables Pin Oak.  it is very nice - especially since i don't have a roommate any more.  
glad to hear that the family is doing well
what are you doing at your new job?  accounting?
what about the firls - what are they doing?
