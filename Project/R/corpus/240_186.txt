Jason,

I need your help on 2 EASY things -

1)  I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.  United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.  What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?  And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.

2)  THIS IS REAL DEAL:  Merced Irrigation District.  They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.  I gave them an indication of $3.85.  I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.  Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?  They were concerned about what credit would require.  

Please let me know as soon as possible!  I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!

Thanks,

Kim
