Gang,
	I want to make it very clear that the questions I am having Pam ask are not meant to put anyone one on the defensive. From what I can tell so far, we have a process that is at best inefficient and at worst broken. Pam will be asking a lot of questions going forward because she does not know your process and she is on task to learn it. Please have patience and offer guidance on how we can get these issues resolved so we can better put to use everyone's time. We are all paid to fix problems, not point fingers. I have a lot of faith in the people in the Portland office, that is why I am asking Pam to go to you guys for guidance. If anyone has any issues going forward please feel free to contact me at 503-807-8959 or e-mail me. 

							          Thanks
								Chris
