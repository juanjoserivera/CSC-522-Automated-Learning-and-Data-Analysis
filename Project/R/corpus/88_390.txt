Wendi:

You don't believe everything Tana tells you, do you?  Haven't you realized she's just trying to get out of work?  At least now you know who really does the work in the Swap Group.

We will prepare your CA for you (since Tana won't).  Will you send Poli-Twine's address and fax number?

Thanks!

Marie
