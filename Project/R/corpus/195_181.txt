It's so nice to hear from you!

Actually, we're coming this weekend.  We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San Juan's (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.

Thanks again,
Susan
