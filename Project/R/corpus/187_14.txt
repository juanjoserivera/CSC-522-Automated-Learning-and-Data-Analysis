were they still good?  not as good as right out of the oven i bet.
i'm glad they were consumed.  i am doing well...market aside.....i worked out chest, tris , bis and abs this morn.
i've got a new anal retentive running schedule made up...ha ha
we'll see how that goes.  let me know what time i can shoot for having dinner ready.  I may swing by a store on the way home.
