Getting short means I'm selling now - expecting the price to go down - and 
then buying.
Getting long means buying now - expecting the price to go up - and then 
selling.
I think you should be doing this with cattle futures.  


Right now I down $290,000.00 for the day.

Buddy,

Surely you jest!  Oh, don't buy Lucent either.  I think they are preparing
to file Chapter 11.  Yea, I'll bet if I had not let Ma fall out of the truck
she would have really bragged on me.  I know.  Terrible.  I do recall her
spanking me a long time ago!!!  Today is Friday and I am happy.  Hey, what
is getting short mean?  I hear people speaking of this thing all the time
but I don't know.  Dow is kicking tail today.
I saw that mortgage rates rose today.  Did you really lose that much
money???  I would be climbing upon top of my DWS(dow work station) to jump
off.  That's my latest saying.  I am not making new paragraphs just
rambling.  Have a good weekend.
