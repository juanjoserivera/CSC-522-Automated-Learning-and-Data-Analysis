Attached is a revised NDA.  Please note, Mark Taylor changed your new 
language a bit.

Tana,

Thanks for your help.  We will hold off on sending one to Continental at this 
time.  Please have a lawyer initial the EGL NDA with the following changes:
? Their legal name is EGL, Inc.
? Remove EnronOnline
? Replace EnronOnline with more ambiguous terminology, should we choose to 
put the product on "a different platform or product or service offered by 
ENW."

I'd like to get this signed and sent out today.

Thanks,

Fred
