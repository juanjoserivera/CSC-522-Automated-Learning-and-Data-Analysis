Glad I gave you such a GLOWING review.

Subject: RE: FW: Escrow Agreement

I am printing the Fee Agreement right now.  It is my understanding Marisa 
Reuter is reviewing the Escrow Agreement, so I plan on calling her tomorrow 
for her comments.  Then, the plan is to find out how many need to be executed 
and get the ink.

Also, I am revising the Incumbency Certificate right now to be signed by 
Duran, Presto and Tricoli.  Kay, I will bring for your initials in a few 
minutes.
