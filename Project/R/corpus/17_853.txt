The last message in this trail is McMahon's note to the Management Committee members regarding allocations and an attached spreadsheet with his proposed acceptance of allocations.  Just FYI.  

I met with Kent Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to Brad, Jenny, and Beth today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has already reviewed Kevin Sweeney's budget for Operations.  Kevin reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and Kent says that Jeff and Ray are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.  --Sally
