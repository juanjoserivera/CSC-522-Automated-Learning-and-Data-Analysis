Build route is a very vital part of what we use every day. Any change to it must go thru me.

The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface. Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.

Please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed.
