On PRC:  In the next few days, I will be able to give Tina an idea on the time when we will start Senior Directors in the June 11th meeting and we will keep you posted that day on timing. 

Contracts:  I met this morning with Robert Jones and Ryan Seleznov on contracts for Brent and Bob.  They were going to get with Michelle Cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day. (Legal has their offsite starting Wednesday, so we will be out of luck for legal help after today.)  I will keep you posted.  I believe that these new contracts will be well received. 

Q2 Goals:  Patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and Philippe for next Monday at 3:00.
