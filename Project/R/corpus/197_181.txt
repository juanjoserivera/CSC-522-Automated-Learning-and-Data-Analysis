Hi Honey,

I hope you are having a good day, I sure enjoyed playing a bit this morning. (Although I had a little bout of blue bush) I just love having you around all the time. 

I don't want turkey for dinner, and since it's payday, I wanna take us out to dinner. Where would you like to go?  Or we can be turds again tonight and to to YOKO's tomorrow, or whatever.

I am suddenly actually busy figuring out the estate VS the newcompany stuff, it is fun to be busy and needed.

I love you very much and can't wait to see you tonight to show you the new license!

Love,

Cara Freeland
