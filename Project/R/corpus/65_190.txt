Scott,
The wife is out of town until Saturday night.    I can play alot of golf on Saturday,  but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday.     I will be available for the golf marathon on Saturday.    I have one player for Saturday morning,  but I dont have a player for Sat. afternoon yet, although I have another co-worker who is interested.
Should I fill this spot as well?

JMF
