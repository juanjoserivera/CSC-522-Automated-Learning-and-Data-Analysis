Ehud,

Sorry for the delay in replying to your message.
I was on the road a lot. I am in London right now and
plan to attend the conference.

I am leaving on Saturday morning for Houston.

I have asked Shirley to get tickets for one of the evening you mentioned.
I should know by Thursday if the tickets are available.

Vince
