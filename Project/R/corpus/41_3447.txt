babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with execs may not have occured yet.  nevertheless, you'll have a darned good idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?

anywho, let's see what response i get back.  maybe they'll want to push back.

her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place previously).  now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even more gorgeous (if that's possible).

best,
Jeff
