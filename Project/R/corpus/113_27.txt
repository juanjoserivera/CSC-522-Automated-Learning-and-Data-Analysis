Thanks for your message.  We met about the fire drill process yesterday
and will have something shortly.  One of the issues we are facing is the
absence of "floor wardens" -- people who know the procedure and can help
it move smoothly if there is a problem.  If you are willing to
volunteer, contact mike terraso.  thanks
