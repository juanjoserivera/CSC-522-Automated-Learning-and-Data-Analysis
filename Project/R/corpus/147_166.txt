It was good.... I went down around noon and hung out for a couple of hours.  It is amazing how excited everyone is for the Texan's to start up.  Thank you very much for the tickets it was a lot of fun.  It seemed like everyone but me knew who they were going to take in the draft.  Look for a check the next couple of days I plan on sending you $25,000 that I would like you to put with the rest of my cash for now.

Thanks Again,

Jon
