Debbie:
If you have availability for either session, please sign me up.  I was unsure 
I would be able to attend until now, hence the late notice.
Thanks,
John

Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an 
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past 
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have 
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not 
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They 
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its 
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do &reality checks8, create a 
&rallying point8 and ensure Enron,s executive management is on the &same 
page8 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  You 
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don,t expect to simply sit and listen to 
presentations. 
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own 
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not 
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activities, 
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, 
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we 
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you 
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do 
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that 
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie 
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.  

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these 
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for first 
choices as much as possible.  

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by 
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.

Thank you.
