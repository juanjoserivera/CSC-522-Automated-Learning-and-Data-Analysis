-  It doesn't need to hit the dpr.
-  Mike's job is not to respond to rfp's
-  If this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year - which is another problem 
-  Finally, I could of paid Mike half of what I paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat. He needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business.  We're not trying to build Stat Oil here.
-  If we don't reward our originators properly, we won't have any.

Having said all that.  If your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid, maybe that's the best answer.

Call me.
