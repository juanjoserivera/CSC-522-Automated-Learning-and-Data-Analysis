We may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function.  We had a lunch meeting with John Lavorato, Dave Delainey, Wes, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (Evan Hughes) under EES.  Final decision expected this week.  --Sally
