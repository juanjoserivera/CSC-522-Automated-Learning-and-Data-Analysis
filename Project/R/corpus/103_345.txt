I think we should talk with them if the have the cash.  However, I get very nervous when anyone would commit $100 to $200 million with limited due diligence.  Also, I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.  Preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi8ng to stabilize anything.  $1 to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.  As to your involvement, you made the right call.
