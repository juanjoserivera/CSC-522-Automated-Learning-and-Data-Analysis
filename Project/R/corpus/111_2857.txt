Ian,

Sorry for a delay in responding to you.
I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow.

The problem is not  with the lawyers. We worked on our presentation
materials together with a professor from another university
and we agreed to use these materials only internally.

We have to honor our commitment to him. I am sure
that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had
made a similar commitment to you.

Vince

 What do I need to do to move this thing forward?
I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers.  They only know how 
to stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society.  If it were 
not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a 
chance.
