I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest.
They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.

The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.
He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.

Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the Harris county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.     
She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.

Life is less fair to dumbasses
