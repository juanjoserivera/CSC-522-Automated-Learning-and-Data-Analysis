This whole experience must be too much fun for you...getting to work with all these young pilots (any of them single?) and strutting your stuff.  

The trip to Park City was fantastic.  We had some really good meals and managed two solid days of skiing.  It dumped 2 feet of snow Sunday night so we had tons of powder on Monday to ski through...and to cushion our falls.  Tuesday was absolutely beautiful, sunny but still below freezing.  The views from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking.  Monique took all the pictures on her digital camera, so as soon as she uploads them I'll be able to check them out and order a few.  This is my first day back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another floor pretty soon...too much sensitive information up here I suppose.  It's fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who declined the UBS offer and will be housed on the other floor as well, so I will have company.  I've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job front...another company in Seattle and one in Richmond, VA that my old trader Larry told me about.  I'm still glad I made the decision I did and am excited to see where that choice ultimately leads me.  Even Tobin (from my first group here at Enron) is trying to help my find something in the Pacific Northwest.  I'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his acquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations.  

Glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the "effort", and I'll talk to you soon.

Love, 
Subaru
