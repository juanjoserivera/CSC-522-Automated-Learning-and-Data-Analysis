Beth,

My last e-mail should have read as follows ending with "volumes".  

Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is 
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the &Repurchasers8) to 
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).    The parties 
further agree that the term &Transporter8 when used in this Contract, 
including, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11, shall include any 
company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree 
that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such 
Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the 
same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any such 
Repurchaser, Enron and NEGM  scheduled and nominated the same volumes.   

In the event this is not acceptable, please let me know how you would like 
this Section to read.  With regards to imbalances,  I would direct you to 
section 4.3.  As an example, if  Enron nominates 10MMbtus and only 8 are 
placed in the line,  2 will be made up by the transporter  the cost is 
Enrons, and 10 would be delivered to NEGM.   And so the  opposite holds for 
NEGM.  If 10 could not be accepted by NEGM, its transporter would respond 
accordingly, and NEGM would be responsible for the cost.

Enron's  concern is with NEGM's desire to claim force majeure as a result of 
an event by its customer downstream.  Force majeure must  take place at the 
delivery point.. 

Hope this helps!  Have a great weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
