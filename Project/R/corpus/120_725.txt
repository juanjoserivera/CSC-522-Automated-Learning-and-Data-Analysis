Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

Thanks

Louise
