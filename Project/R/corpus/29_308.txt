Don I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God hate to see pain hit a family member.  Even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and security knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  When you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill us with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work everything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your Christian walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities.  

When you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.  Sharing Christ with someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations.  In Hebrews were told  to encourage the brethren.  I would consider it an honor to hear form you again....keep the faith...  its all we have.........
