Jesssseka!!!!

I know, it's been ages since we've chatted.  I will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time.  

I got Clay's message and thought I'd replied, but obviously I forgot.  I'm actually going out of town next weekend.  Which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again.  Of course, I suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with Jen and Caycie's weddings coming up.

I talk to you soon,

Sue

Glad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic.
