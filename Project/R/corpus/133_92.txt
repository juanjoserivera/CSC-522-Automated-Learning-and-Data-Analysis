I saved the file for us to send to Susan Trevino for all the book access requests.  I added the control group and put goss, kam, valdes and his people in there.  So make sure you add that group to your book requests.  Please take a look at this file and let me know if we need to make any changes.  I plan on sending this file to Susan Trevino by tomorrow afternoon.  The file in located in the Netco directory under controls/desk matrix.  Thanks.
