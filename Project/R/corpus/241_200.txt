I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.  

Thanks for your help!

Kim

Of course I remember you.........did you get the fax I sent yesterday?
Actually looking forward to taking you sailing on my boat!  We usually try
to gather a group and go for the day/evening and stop at the boardwalk after

for chips/margarita's at Cadillac Bar.  Yes, place I charter though does all

the lessons - ASA certified - can get you info or you can pick it up
when we go out on my boat too.

Have a great trip/weekend..........lets talk next week and catch up!
