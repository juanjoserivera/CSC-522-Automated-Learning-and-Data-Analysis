Mike, we appreciate you keeping Jeff in the loop for the 2001 U.S. Open.  
However, Jeff is not a golfer and has decided to decline this invitation.  
Thank you for the offer. 
Katherine for Jeff Skilling

Jeff, this message is self explanatory.? Pat Arthur of our office is "in 
charge" of selling and setting up hospitality suites for companies in Texas 
and we have an opportunity for our firm and our firm's friends to sign up 
before he "goes public".? If Enron would be interested, let me know and I 
will make sure it is taken care of.

Regards, 

Mike Buttrey 

PS? thanks again for lunch.
