Becky,

I recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline.  In their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the one or two locations for which Enron has capacity allocations.  Chris Gaskill indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flows for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (only 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.

Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.
