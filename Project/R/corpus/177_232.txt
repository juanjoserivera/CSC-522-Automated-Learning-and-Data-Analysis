hi jill,

ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  

how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  

don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  

work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  

hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  

talk to you soon,
cooper
