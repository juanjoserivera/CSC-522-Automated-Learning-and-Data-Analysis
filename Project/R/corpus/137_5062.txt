I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow, but 
Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready until 
Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would 
appreciate it if you could confirm.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: RE: Delta Documents - Addresses for Delivery

Kay:

The original membership certificate for the 80% interest should be forwarded
for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to the following address:

   Ms. Isabel Parker
   Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP
   520 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor
   New York, NY  10022
   (phone 212-277-4025)

(Greg has asked that the membership certificate be faxed to him (fax
203-674-7646) and me (fax 713-751-3280) on Tuesday before depositing this
with the overnight courier).

If you will also be sending the original signature pages to the Turbine

be forwarded for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to:

   Mr. Gregory F. Lang
   Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker LLP

I am happy to get these documents to the correct place if the signed
documents are in Houston on Tuesday.  Let me know.  Thanks.
