Subject: RE: FW: New lease option

Kay, 
One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get 
into the interconnect queue.  To do so, we must enter into an interconnect 
study agreement and in the past we have entered into these agreements using 
the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying 
that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option 
agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it 
has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time 
we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are 
ready to begin negotiating a construction and connection agreement.  Would 
you please clarify the issue for me?
