We're going to be two ships passing here.  I leave town on Friday and return 
to the office on Wednesday morning.  How about I give you a call when I get 
back.  I am only in a few days and then I am heading to DC for my son's 
college graduation exercises.  ( I know exactly what you are thinking - 
Lordy, she's old!!)

Talk to you then, okay?

Rebecca
