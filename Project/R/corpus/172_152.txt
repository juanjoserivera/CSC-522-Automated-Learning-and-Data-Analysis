suggested draft order:

scenario
5 franchise teams and 7 non-franchise
franchise teams ranked 1 - 5 based on total points of franchise player from previous year

First the supplemental draft

Round one
# 5 franchise team, # 7 supplemental , # 4 franchise , # 6 supplemental and so forth and so on

with a non snake system going from there

ok everyone chew on that and spit back
