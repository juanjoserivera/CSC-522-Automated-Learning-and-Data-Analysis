Here are the quotes from the Moorings.  One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.  I talked to Jim on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc.  Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?  Other potential sailors to suggest?  Luck curtailing Jamie's guilt trip?
