I'm sure you don't want me to remind you in detail of your own birthday experience?  Europa, the shrubs across the street?...and it wasn't 2 hours, more like an hour to an hour and a half.  Besides, I think Bass spent a little more time than myself praying to the porcelain god (at least I had the good sense to just pass out when I got home).
