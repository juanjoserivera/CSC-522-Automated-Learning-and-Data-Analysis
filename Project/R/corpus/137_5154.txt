It is Father's Day and we will do what you want. If you want to go there, 
that's great.  I'm happy to tell Tom, his wife and all the world that what we 
do that weekend is 100% up to you.  

It sounds like he has the impression that I'm the hold up.

This is for the Father's Day week. I told Tom you were probably going to NY 
for a business trip. I don't see any way around not giving him the home 
number.
