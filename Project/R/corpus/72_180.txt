You are so good to me!  As long as we are together, it does not really matter where we stay.  I would prefer a king size bed as opposed to two double.  Although, if we mess up one, we can always use the other one.  The Lay Reviews are supposed to be over at 5:00, so any time after that.  I don't really have a preference on the return flight. 

Love you
