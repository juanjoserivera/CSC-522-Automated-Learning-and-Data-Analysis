She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs 
on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to 
take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws 
on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be 
said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.

I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are 
kinda tough.  Good luck.

What kind of kitty does Ingrid have??

Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.
