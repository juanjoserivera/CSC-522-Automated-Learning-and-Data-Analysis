sorry I did not get back with you last night, we were up in Navasota all weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air.  We also went to the Renaissance Festival.  Things are getting pretty hectic around here.  There are a number of individuals who are responsible for destroying one of the best companies in America in less than a year.  It is all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in.  We are all just trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best.  If I do get laid off, I just hope to get a really good package.  

How are things in Denver?  Good I hope.  How is that baby?  Is she getting bigger?  I hope so.  Drop me a line and let me know what is going.  Thanks for the call.
