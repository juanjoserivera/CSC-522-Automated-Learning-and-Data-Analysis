We technically should have no third party transactions.  If we do, we need to move them to the NG-Price book.  Please let me know if this is the case.  Also, Casey & I will be both be out of the office tomorrow.  If you need someone in Houston to help get questions answered please call Andrea.

Thanks,
Stacey
