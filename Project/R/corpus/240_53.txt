I was working out at 5:30 this a.m.!  What's the matter with you?  Were you able to get the trailer off of your truck?  When I got home, Suzanne came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.  Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met Suzanne at the park for a jog.  Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City. 

Lonely, huh?  When does Lawrence move in?
