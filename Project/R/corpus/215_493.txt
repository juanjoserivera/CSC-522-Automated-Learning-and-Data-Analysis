Sue --

I agree with your arguments.  The other problem with SCE's analysis is that they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money.  

What California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates for 4 years.  All of the margin they "earned" was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access.  If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, this implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs.  

The entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate.
