Alan --

1.	Is Sue Mara going with you?  Who else is going?  Anyone from commercial or scheduling?  My understanding is that Ray Alvarez is attending?

2.	Do we have a list of issues that we want to go through with the CAISO?  Maybe outlining our Top Ten before the meeting and getting internal agreement (maybe even with the other participants) makes sense?

Thanks
