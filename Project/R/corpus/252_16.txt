Murray,

Thank you for your interest in our group. I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening. We will likely have some openings in February (it always seems to happen around that time). As you might assume, we are interested in hiring the best person for the job, if you were that person, then we would do our best to facilitate your move. 

Again, thank you for your interest, and if you have further questions just give me a call.

Bill
