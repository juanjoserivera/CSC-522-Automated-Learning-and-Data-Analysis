darling boy-

i'm never mad at you, never ever, and i really do adore you to death and
forever and can't bear the idea that we wouldn't be friends till death do us
part, and that i wouldn't be welcome in your life, so no, i was never mad
and don't even remember which of my (many) soliloquoys you may have
interrupted or are referring to but i do know that i have a rather
boisterous personality and perhaps i stepped on your toes and this is not my
intention and i adore you and my company is about to go under so the idea of
being unemployed AND having you upset with me is far too much for my
delicate self to handle...
