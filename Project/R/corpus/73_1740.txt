Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.  What would you have me do?  

Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job, or activly look for a new job?
