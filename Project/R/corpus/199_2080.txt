Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.

(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?

(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.

Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara
