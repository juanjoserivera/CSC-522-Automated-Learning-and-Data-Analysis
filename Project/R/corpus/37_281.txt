When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I guess that means Chris has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas time travel.

While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.
