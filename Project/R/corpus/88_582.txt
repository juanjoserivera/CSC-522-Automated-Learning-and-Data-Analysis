Tanya:

Please see Tom Doukas's request below.  Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. et al dated March 29, 2001, with a $25,000,000 cap.  This guaranty secured obligations of Enron Credit, Inc. in connection with a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement.  The cap was increased to $100,000,000 by amendment dated May 15, 2001.  Are you okay with adding ECT Europe Finance, Inc. as an additional guaranteed party?

Thanks!

Marie
