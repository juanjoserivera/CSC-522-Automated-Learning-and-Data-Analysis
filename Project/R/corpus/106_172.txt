Veronica,
 She did not make the changes you requested to cover both contract and 
non-contract transactions.  What do you want me to do.  Her language works so 
long as we have a written contract covering each of the physical obligations.

Carol and Dan--

Per the message and attachments below, please take a final look to see 
whether their comments to our proposed revisions are acceptable to both of 
you.

Thanks again,
