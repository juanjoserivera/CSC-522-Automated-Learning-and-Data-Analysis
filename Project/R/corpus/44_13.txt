Julie,

As I am getting off night shift today, I will be unable to attend the HR presentation.  I believe I filled out all of the necessary paperwork (W-4, direct deposit, and employment application) to get started and I dropped the beneficiary and benefits paperwork on your desk this morning.  Please write me if there is anything else that you need from me.

Craig Dean
