Could you check out the sitter thing?  We could drop off Michael and take the 
Enron Field shuttle.  I don't need to stay late - I'm sure 2 hours would do 
it.

I would like to go to the Enron booth but it's truly your call. I bet we can
get Choc to help but I need to call her asap...
That's neat about the head of the PTL group.
I think you should do some mom and son stuff with Michael. Your right about
me and a large group of people on a boat...
love, NM
