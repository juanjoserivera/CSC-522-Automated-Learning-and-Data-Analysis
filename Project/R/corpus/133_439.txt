still do not have anything from a contract standpoint.  I will try and put some time into it today.  AS of last Friday, I now have responsibility for the East desk instead of the Central, but I will include Scott Palmer in my work since he now is over the Central.  I am not abandoning you, it is just that my workload has drastically increased trying to wrap up central desk issues, get Scott up to speed and get myself up to speed on the East desk.  We will get a resolution ASAP.  Thanks.
