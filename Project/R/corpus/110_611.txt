Ehud,

Thanks for your  message.

I have talked briefly to Rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute Greg Whalley 
for Jeff. I assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from Enron than a specific person.

Of course, we have to get on Greg's calendar but I can make these arrangements as soon as I hear from you.
