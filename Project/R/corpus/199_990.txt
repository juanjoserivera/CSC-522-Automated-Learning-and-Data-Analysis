need to bring jewelry? money? stockings?  I mean, what did YOU wear in LA?

I think people dress in clothes.  I saw everybody in everything, it's
just that Patina seemed a little bit snootier than the others (the food
is fabulous though).  Maybe the Parkway Grill isn't on the list because
that's the wrong name of the restaurant.  Maybe it's really Perkway
Grillades.
Love you lots.
