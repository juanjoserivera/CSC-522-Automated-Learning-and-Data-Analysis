POINTY HEAD!!!!!!     I KNEW IT!  Poor little fella.

I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible.  I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.  Talk about space, I GOT IT!  For now anyway.  Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.  Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.  I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.  Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.

The apartment is still pretty empty.  I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.  I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat.....
