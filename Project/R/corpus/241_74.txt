Subject:	City of Pasadena invoicing

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you will be unable to attend. Thanks.
