Eggcellent!!!  Yes, I did have your watch.  However, due to lean times on the 
Nemec ranch, I was forced to see what the cash equivalent of your watch would 
be.  Does $10 sound fair.  Anyway I took the ten bucks, which thankfully 
acounted for both my beers last night.   Chalk up another one to the Nemec 
leisure activity fund.

Will you help me decorate an egg? 

By the way, have you seen my watch laying around your house?? I am thinking 
that I left it over there Sunday night. 

Thanks
