Hope,

I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

Hugs
