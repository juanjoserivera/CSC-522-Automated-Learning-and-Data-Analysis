Coulda sworn I mentioned DB when we had dinner with your guy at Bizou.

Let's talk more to discuss the latest developments.  Glad to hear that it's 
still moving along. I'm in town tonite.  

You MUST keep this strictly confidential----I've know Colleen for years.  
She's a sweet dear friend of mine.  But she's driving me fucking crazy.  I am 
very happy that you two are buddies and having fun together and that she's 
being such a big help with your wedding.  But it's going to be best for you 
and me and Colleen and Scott and Tony Blair and Oprah Winfrey and Sammy Soza, 
and everyone else, if my contact with the wonderful Ms Silva is minimized in 
the immediate future.  Don't worry about it.  No big deal. Just want and need 
you to know.  And please keep it very confidential.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

OK, it looks like DealBench has hit our radar screen hard here.  Can you
help me get a meeting set up with the right people??

Look like the strat sourcing group in Houston is requesting a "sand box" to
play in to test out our product.  Did you ever get a chance to put in a good
word there?

David Hoffman wrote me and said he really enjoyed spending time with you and
said you were such a smart and thoughtful guy.  Thought you might like the
compliment.  I am going to check out his house as a wedding site on Thursday
with Colleen and then go have dinner with Lisanne.  Any chance you guys want
to come along?

Write back soon...
