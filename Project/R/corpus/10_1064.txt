Sorry,sorry, sorry. 
Havent had internet access at home for past 5 weeks.  Much easier to write these at home as when I'm done trading I don't want to look at my computer.  
For november, very neutral.  Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching, and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with cash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt, the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents at settlement.  Been buying a lot of y/y cantango as I think next summer will be a piece but longer term gas story still very real and customers know it.  Wouldnt be surprised to see 2/3 go to 50+.  I think x has some room to go up, but not a lot.  Dont want to play the market from the long side as been burned before trying to get long a market that is still in a downtrend.  Seems like the curve will just keep rolling down with each expiry.  All the winter months might settle 2.25.  As such, the best thing to be short is jan.
