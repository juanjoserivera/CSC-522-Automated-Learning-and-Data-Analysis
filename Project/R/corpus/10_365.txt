John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within 
Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we 
should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of 
our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it 
has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie
