Mark,

We are really swamped and I would like to keep our involvement in
conferences to a reasonable minimum. I can promise that we shall help you
with a future conference if it happens to be in Houston.

Vince

Vince:

I am sorry to hear about your scheduling conflict. Your expertise would have
been a great value to our conference.  Is there anyone else at your company
whom you could recommend as a speaker?  Thanks again for your time.
