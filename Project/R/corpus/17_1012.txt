There are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the Netco list.  

Two of the three are Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to Louise.  

Another excellent player is Shona Wilson.  She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC before joining Enron, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.  

I am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netco.  If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for Netco.  --Sally
