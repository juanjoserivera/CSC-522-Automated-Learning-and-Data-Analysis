I think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.  If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.  Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out. Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.
