Norman,

Thanks for your message. Still struggling with a trip schedule,
trying to reconcile many different itineraries. I should connect with Greg who is 
in London and firm the plans up  by tomorrow morning.

I am attaching a draft of a non-disclosure agreement. Please, take a look at it
at your leisure and let me now what  you think.

I have also FedExed you some reading materials about the power and natural
gas prices.

Vince
