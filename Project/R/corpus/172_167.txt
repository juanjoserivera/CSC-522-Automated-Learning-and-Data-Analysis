I would still like to play golf this weekend b/c it is the friendship that is fun
I might even take on Ernesto for the Brock dog challenge

It is truly sick what happened , I was talking to a broker that was in the second world trade tower as it got
hit and he was describing what was going on.  Several people I know made it out of both buildings but many are not 
yet accounted for , so at this time all there is is hope.

May everyone have a peaceful day
