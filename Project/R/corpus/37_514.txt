FYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.

I really enjoyed our talk last night.  You gave me some really good advice.  

I'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.  I think Alina would love the water rafting.  We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.

Talk to you soon.  Chad really, really wants to have Tom come over to play soon!
