Sorry that we have missed one another by phone.  I agree that the challenges 
of EBS are going to be very exciting.  Enron has certainly made a commitment 
to make communications a large part of our future success.  I would suggest 
that to get more details that you talk with Scott Pleus.  He is one of my 
direct reports, who most recently has been the business controller for 
Emerging Products, including bandwidth.  Scott's focus will soon shift to 
focus full time on trading operations for bandwidth.  Give Scott a call at 
X36577 and I am sure that he would be glad to visit with you about the 
industry and opportunities that he sees within EBS.

I am extremely interested in learning more about Enron Broadband Services and 
George Hope suggested I talk to you.  I take pride in being part of the Power 
Trading Group since late 1997 and see many similarities emerging in the 
Intelligent Network / BOS.   I do NOT want anyone to think I,m eager to leave 
Scheduling in our group, but I know that the challenge and experiences in 
growing these technologies for Enron is going to be awesome.  

Until we get a chance to meet, you can page me at 800-980-2182 or by return 
E-mail.
Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Corry Bentley
