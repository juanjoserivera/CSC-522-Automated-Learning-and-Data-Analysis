Group,

CAPS will be down from HE 20 through HE 1 on Saturday morning.  We will have to use workspace and run Enpower to CAPS after HE 1.  We may want to run Enpower to CAPs early (or at least create finals) so that we do not lose any data if the whole thing gets erased.  Please call with questions.
Good luck.

Thanks,
Bill
