Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.

I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.

Good luck with the rest of the season.
