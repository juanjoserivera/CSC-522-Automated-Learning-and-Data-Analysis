Michael,

I think that Keynes was right on the money.
He had great insights into the forward markets.

By  the way, what are your thoughts about CA?

Did you guys get this?

I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about
risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to
you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use
classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision
is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the
President's curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the
customers' curves or equivalently the PUC's curve.

I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the
assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for
large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility
curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.

Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its
role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market
participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher
than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower
than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers
(including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the
certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower
bid prices.

Just some random thoughts,
Michael
