Terri,

We are definitely watching the ballgame at suzanne's on saturday.  I am getting an email list together so if you have some people you want to add, just let me know.  How was Tennessee and your Thanksgiving?  Mine was just so, so.  Worrying about work and my friends (and self) getting laid off.  I do hope all is well with you - call me sometime this week -

Kim
