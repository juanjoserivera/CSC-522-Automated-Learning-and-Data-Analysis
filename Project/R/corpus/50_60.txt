Lorraine,
	This is Southern's Gallup contract.  I've looked at our yellow file we keep down here and the original agreement only allowed alt RP's & DP's within the path, in the direction of flow, at the discounted rate.  Then, I see an amendment to allow them alternate DP's at the CA Border.  I don't see anything else here.  Are you aware of any deals that allowed them to use alt RP's in East of Thoreau?

Ramona,
	Can you ask Dennis to look in Envision &/or pull the official contract file for you and check to see if there are any other amendments? 

Thanks, 
Lindy
