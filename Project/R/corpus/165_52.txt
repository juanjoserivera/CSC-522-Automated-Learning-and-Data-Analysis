Hello Dr. Jacobs -

Mike asked me to follow up with you to pass along his schedule for his visit 
to OU in April.  Due to Mike's heavy schedule, he said that he plans to be 
there on Thursday for the lecture and he will be happy to join the group at 
The Mont following the lecture, but unfortunately he will need to return to 
Houston on Friday morning.  He asked me to pass along his regrets for being 
unable to attend the banquet on Friday evening and the Board meeting on 
Saturday.

I have contacted the Montford Inn to reserve a cottage for Mike, but they 
said they are booked.  They also said that they are holding 6 rooms for the 
OU Special Events group for April 19th.  If one of the six rooms is not being 
held for Mike, can you please suggest another hotel or inn.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

Cathy'/Mike.

Thanks for the prompt response and the quotes. I will certainly use one of
them and will use the picture we currently have of Mike on file in the
Penney's Leadership Program.

Mike, I think there might be several of the Board of Advisor members
attending your class on April 19th. Was wondering if you might consider
joining some of them for a beer at The Mont afterwards, since it appears you
will not be able to attend the Board of Advisors meeting on Saturday, April
21st. I know they would like to have the opportunity to meet and visit with
you.

Again, thanks for the promptness in getting back to me.
