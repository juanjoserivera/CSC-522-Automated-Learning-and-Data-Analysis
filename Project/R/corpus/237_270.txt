Good morning.... Callaway Park buys Disney World ( Milly told me that one)..... 

The Management is trying hard to put on a good face forward, but they fucked this one up nicely.

My plans are simple.. hang out to see if I get paid... after that, not sure. 

I am thinking about taking golf lessons... that how bad things have gotten.

Yikes.. PS, send us a new e-mail of the kids...

Thanks for the note, TIC.
