Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.
