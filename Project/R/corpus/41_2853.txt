I'll be in the office very shortly.  My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling:
 

he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit
he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to "cooperate" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers

I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.  He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.

Michael:  I call you soon as I get in--next 15-30 minutes.

 

Best,

Jeff
