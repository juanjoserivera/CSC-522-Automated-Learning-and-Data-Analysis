So what night is better for you? I forgot about the offer for tickets to the
ball game Friday. Do
you want to do dinner Thursday and the ball game Friday? NM

I'm just getting out of a training class.
My bet is it will be cancelled.
I would love to take my bride out to dinner. If you do yoga Thursday we
could do dinner Friday. How does that sound? Let me know what you think and
I will write Charlotte. NM
