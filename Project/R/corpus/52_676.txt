Matt,

That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it. 

Thanx

Chris
