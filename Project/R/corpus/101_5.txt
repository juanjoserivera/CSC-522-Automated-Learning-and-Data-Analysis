Jeff,

Lets make dinner plans to discuss this.....Just kidding.  While Scott was here, we arranged for him to be included in the Oct 29th Trading Track interviews.  This seems to be the best thing for him given that he really wants to become a trader.  Once in the program, he'll have 4 rotations (6 months each), some of these would likely be on the west desk.

Mike and I have talked and both agree that it makes good sense for Scott to join west gas given his experience in Portland.  However, the only hitch is that Mike cannot unilaterally decide to bring Scott to the desk.  He will need to negotiate this with the other desk heads and the program director.  This should not be an issue.
