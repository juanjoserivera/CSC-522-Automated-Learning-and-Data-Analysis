I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will respond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

Step	Explanation	Time Frame	
1. Contact each other <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?UserInformationRequest>	Contact each other after your listing has ended. Like you, buyers can have emergencies or computer problems. Your high bidder may not be able to respond to you right away for legitimate reasons. 	Generally within 3 business days is a good idea.	
2. Payment Reminder <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?myebayportal>.	Send a payment reminder email to your winning bidder. You can customize the email.	After 3 days but not past 30 days of your listing's close.	
3. Non-Paying Bidder Alert. <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?NPBComplaintForm>	File a Non-Paying Bidder Alert if you still don't get a response or if you feel you may not receive payment. Remember: In order to collect your Final Value Fee credit, you must complete a Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form on time. eBay then will send an email to you and your high bidder. Your high bidder will be reminded to pay you and informed of the consequences if no payment is sent.	After 7 days but not past 45 days of your listing's close.	
4. Request your Final Value Fee credit <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?CreditRequest>.	Request your Final Value Fee credit if you've: a) Filed a Non-Paying Bidder Alert 7 days or more after your listing has ended and b) Tried unsuccessfully to resolve things with your bidder 10 days after you've filed the Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form above. Your refund will be credited to your account within 48 hours.	Within 60 days of your listing's close.	
	Worked things out with the buyer? If you have filed the Final Value Fee credit, you may use the Non-Paying Bidder Warning Removal <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?RemoveNPBWarningShow> to remove the warning for the bidder.	Within 90 days of your listing's close.	
			
Special note about Dutch Auctions: They work the same as other auctions with one exception: You may file a Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form only once per auction for as many bidders as necessary. That is, you cannot go back and file additional Alerts if you have more non-paying bidders from the same auction.  Special note to bidders: If you are a bidder and believe you received an unfair warning, you may appeal it by using eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Appeal Form <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SendQueryEmailShow&subject=npb>. Warnings will remain on your record until they are successfully appealed.  Visit our Non-Paying Bidder Frequently Asked Questions <http://pages.ebay.com/help/basics/f-npb.html>.
