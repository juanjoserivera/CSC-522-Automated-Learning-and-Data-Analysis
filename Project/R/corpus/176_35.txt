Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see it coming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.
 
Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.
 
Jay
