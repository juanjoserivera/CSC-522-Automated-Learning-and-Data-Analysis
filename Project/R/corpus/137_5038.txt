Kent,

Are you sending this (and the opinion and LOC) to me today? I wasn't sure 
where this landed.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

We told Paul Hastings that we would release our Guaranty and the Opinion at
closing on Wednesday.  They were okay with that.  If that's a problem, I can
fax the guaranty and opinion (once I have it signed), with a letter from me
saying you can't release it until funding...
