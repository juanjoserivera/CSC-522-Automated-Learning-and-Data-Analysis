Hi Kathy

Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.
