After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being amortized in 2002.  We need to take that out of your numbers.  Jim and Kiri thought it was approximately $14 million.  Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of $270.  Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach thanks.
