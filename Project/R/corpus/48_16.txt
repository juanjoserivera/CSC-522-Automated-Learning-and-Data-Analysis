Russell, 

Because it covers swaps, a financial lawyer needs to look at it.  Even when 
the primary exposure is physical.

		 Subject: FW: Gulf Guarantee for Enron

Stacy,
Attached is a draft guaranty from Gulf Resources to cover physical 
transactions between their sub, Crestar Energy Marketing and ENA.  Can you 
please review this format and provide your comments.  The guaranty covers 
purchase/sale and swap transactions, although our primary exposure is only 
physical natural gas.  I am not sure if one of the financial attorney's needs 
to look at this too

Thanks
Russell


**Randy, Take a look at the guaranty and the types of transactions we have 
with this counterparty to understand the need for the guaranty.
