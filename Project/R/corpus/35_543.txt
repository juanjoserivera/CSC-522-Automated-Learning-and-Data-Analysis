John:
I am checking with our credit person on the cxross default issue.  Also, we 
have changed our form of Guaranty since the prior one was entered into and I 
would prefer that you consider using the new form.  The main difference is in 
Section 2 where we have made chnages to the mechanics for demanding payment 
under the Guaranty.  These are the exact same mechanics that are in the Enron 
Guaranty that I provideed.  Enclosed is the new form.  Let me know what you 
think.

Carol -

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.
