Alan,
I think you have identified the most pressing issues. Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to "strive for simplicity and transparency." Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be?  In the CISO's proposal the first two "goals" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other. Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points. I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the update.

Bill
