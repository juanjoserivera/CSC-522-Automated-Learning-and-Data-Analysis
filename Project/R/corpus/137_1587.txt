I was referencing your question about power and gas activity obligations when 
I raised the issue of putting it in the exhibits (which we have done pursuant 
to discussions we had last Friday)  My point on the fuel plan  was that 
Reagan deleted it, which was fine with me.  There is language in the contract 
addressing Enron's responsibility to buy gas and fuel oil for the facilities.

Kay -- The fuel activity is so limited in scope that a separate Exhibit is 
questionable.  If you don't want fuel in the contract body, then why not make 
it a subset of the marketing plan.  Fuel activity is directly linked to power 
marketing when running their units. Thanks -- david
