Steve,

I was delayed on my wait out. I probably hit the stop at
6:15.

Let me buy you a coffee this afternoon. What about 2:00?

Vince,

I was at the bus-stop from 5:50 to 6:10 ish, assumed you had been delayed and 
jumped on the next Research Forest bus that came along.

I hope you didn't wait around for me?

regards

Steve
