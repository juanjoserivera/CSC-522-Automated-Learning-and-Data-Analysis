Subject: RE: Trader Web-site Access Project

Kam, David, and Errol -
Please forward to me your region's access criteria no later than 11:00 am, 
Monday, March 19  (see request below from Tuesday). We need to pull 
everyone's access information together in order to plan Security requirements 
for the Trader Web-site. Thank you for your help!
Shirley
