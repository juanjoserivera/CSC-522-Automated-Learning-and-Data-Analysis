Glen,

So its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hitting on some waitress at Hooters.  Ahhhhh those were the days!   How are things going?  What's new in the world?  Things here seem to be running there course.  Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest "Bud Fox" for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end.  Well I think Bud might have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.  I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty Enron has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat.  We seem to have run out of cash and can't pay the bills.  Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.  Its kind of got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.  I can stay where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of like sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is. Or, I can try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the problem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.  Hence the soul searching and dilemma.  Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note, see how things are going.  Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could be worse.

I'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off.  And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.  I get in late Friday the 21st and head back to Houston Sunday the 30th.  Maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.  Anyway I have to get back to work.  I hope all is well in Cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight
