It is not clear to me what precipitated this most inquiry from Anadarko or
why it is being made at this time.  I thought that we had gotten over this
hump.

Assuming that you are not anxious for this task, I propose that I tell them
that, because you are currently tied up on other matters, I will be the
temporary representative on the committee and that after the holidays we
will be back in touch further.

Such a response would parry this somewhat odd inquiry / statement, and will
allow us to reassess the situation when Andy gets on board and gets his feet
wet.

Agree?
