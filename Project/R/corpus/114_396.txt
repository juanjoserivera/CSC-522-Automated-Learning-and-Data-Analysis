I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone.

Subject:	FW: Meeting with Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr.

Wanted you to be aware that Mayor Brown is inviting Jeff to meet with him, either in San Francisco or elsewhere.  Please advise, but I know that Jeff would probably not travel to California.

Mark Koenig and Andy Fastow will discuss meeting with Mayor Brown on the CalPERS issue.

Thanks,
Joannie
