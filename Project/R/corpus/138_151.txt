Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?
