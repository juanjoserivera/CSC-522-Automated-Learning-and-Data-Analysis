Sounds like a good plan!  I'm at 1920 Banks Street, the last street off 
Shepherd before you hit the Swest Fwy.  So, when you leave church, go down 
Shepherd, then make a right on the last street before the fwy.  Go past the 
1st stop sign and then I'll be about the 3rd or 4th house on the left, a 
taupe colored cottage with a pointy roof and vines growing halfway up the 
side of the house.  My home # is 529-1038.  See you at 12:45!

If you don't mind dropping me back by home after we tour, I'll have Henry 
drop me at your new house after church on Sunday......maybe at 1245....I 
haven't seen your new digs.; Where exactly are they?
