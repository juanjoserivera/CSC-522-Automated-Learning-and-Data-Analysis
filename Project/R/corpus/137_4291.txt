Subject: Acceptance Test for FCEL

Kay,

I am gathering responses to Interrogatories from the CT AG, CL&P, UI and some 
enviro group called Environment Northeast regarding our fuel cell filing with 
the DPUC.  Can you help me answer the following questions?  And if you can, 
will you?  Ultimately, we want to respond with as little information as 
necessary to answer the exact question and to offier nothing else to them.  
Usual stuff.  

Thanks,

Heather

EN-1. Describe the &acceptance test8 referred to on page 3 of your testimony, 
including performance standards and the period of time over which they will 
be  measured.


EN-12 Please provide copies of any technical, engineering or other reports 
developed by or on behalf of CRRA concerning this project or the use of fuel 
cells.

 I've asked Steve Plauche and Scott Healy to answer this too so answer only 
if you know anything different.



I very much appreciate it!
