Up to you and Anthony.  We have already done a meeting in 3AC - today at 11:15.  We had not been provided info that Anthony had anyone in 3AC.  We had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans - I don't think that Anthony was able to attend.  
 
Your options are to bring them over to ECN 14 at 1:30, or to have them attend a meeting at 1:00 in 2 Allen Center, 12 th floor in the Forum (a meeting room on that floor). I will be conducting that floor meeting at 1:00 for ENW employees in 2 Allen Center - it is Allan Sommers' ISC group.  --Sally
