Can we be even stronger on this?  The short answer is that Joe's resignation 
has no impact on our view toward India.  The evaluation of our asset holdings 
and new business opportunities is the same the day after Joe's resignation as 
it was the day before.  If need be, we can reiterate previous statements 
about our ongoing review of asset positions.  What do you think?

We expect considerable Indian media interest and attempts to interpret the 
implications of Joe Sutton's resignation.  In consultation with Mark Palmer 
and others, we have developed the following statement, which we intend to use 
only in response to media inquiries.  Please let me know if you have any 
comments.

Statement on Impact of Sutton Resignation on Enron in India

Joe Sutton,s departure should not significantly affect Enron,s commitment to 
the Indian market.  In fact, consistent with Enron,s new business lines, we 
are in the process of developing data centers and a fiber optic network in 
India.  Of course, we continuously look to optimize the value of our business 
interests and there may be some related adjustments in our holdings, but we 
expect to continue as a significant participant in the Indian market.

If pressed:
We are not able to comment on specific plans or operations, as it is our 
policy not to comment on the details of potential divestitures or 
acquisitions.
