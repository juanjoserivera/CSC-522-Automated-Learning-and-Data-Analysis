Norman,

Thanks for your message. I treat the Monday 
meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to Prediction
Company and to inform you about Enron's trading operation
and especially about our electronic trading platforms.
The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future 
collaboration. We are especially interested in working with
you on improving the algorithms that support our electronic market
making functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offer
spreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currently
a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage
of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.

I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets
and we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory character
of the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company 
participation is limited to you and Jim. We shall, of course, be glad to meet
with other associates that you may decide to bring to Houston with you. We shall be also
glad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.

Enron side will be represented by Greg Whalley,  President & COO of Enron Wholesale Services,
and myself. We expect John Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, and
my colleague from London, Dr. Steve Leppard, to join us. Shirley is forwarding the agenda and some
additional information to you tonight.

You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail addres: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home
(281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting
you on Sunday.

Vince Kaminski
