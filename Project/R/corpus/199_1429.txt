2:45 Houston time is fine for me.
Also, the Trading Limitation language is NOT intended to kick in for intraday 
limit moves but only at the end of the day (i.e., "closing or settlement

Can we have a call at 3:45 p.m. to see where we all are at and hopefully wrap 
up all issues on the agreements?  Thanks
