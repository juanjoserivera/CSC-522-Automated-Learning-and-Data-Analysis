Deb,

Attached is a spreadsheet that shows my analysis of the Enron Wind Development Corp (Green Power Partners) contract(s).  The asumptions contained in the analysis assume that the following contracts remain in effect through December 31, 2002:

EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to EEMC (1MW ATC)
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to LADWP(1) (21MW Sundays Off Peak)

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Richard
