John, please look at the revisions to Section 3.3 below.  Also, I wanted to 
know if you wanted to make this a monthly contract.  As written it is for 1 
year.


3.3. Buyer's Purchase Obligation.  Buyer shall have the right to take and 
purchase 100 percent of Seller's Daily Deliverability of Gas.  This Agreement 
is entered into with the understanding (i) that Buyer,s takes of Gas 
hereunder are subject to the availability of interruptible services from 
Transporter and (ii) that Buyer plans to resell the Gas production from the 
Receipt Point(s) to other purchasers  If Buyer elects not to purchase Gas 
from Seller for 30 consecutive Days, Seller may terminate this Agreement upon 
10 Days  written notice.  Seller agrees to do all things necessary and 
reasonable to assist Buyer in obtaining the approvals for and/or implementing 
any resale mechanism(s) chosen from time to time by Buyer.


Please advise.
