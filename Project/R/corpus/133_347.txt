what is up rob?  I still have a picture of the four of us on top of that mountain in California with dirt all over us from riding those four wheelers when we were in 9th grade.  I am still here for now - no jokes about the demise of the big E.  Pretty rough carnage through here.  I am sure you guys in California are loving it.  I will give you my secondary email if in fact I am one of the next one's out - plove@houston.rr.com.  Ev just had a baby boy last week - he was one month early and the boy still weighted 9 lbs. 5 ounces.  21 inches long.  His name is Devon Lamar.  Ev has changed companies - his new email address is ESmith@kanekatexas.com.  I am sure he would love to hear from you.  Hope all is well with everyone.
