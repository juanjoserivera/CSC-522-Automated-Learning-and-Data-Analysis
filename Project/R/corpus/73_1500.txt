BETH!!!  Donna!!!   Welcome to the party!

Wade, I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does.  

1.  Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?

2.  There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.  Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?  Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.
