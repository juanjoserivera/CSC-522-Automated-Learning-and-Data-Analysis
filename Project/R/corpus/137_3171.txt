Leatha,

I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition 
to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time frames are 
mentioned in your explanation.  

Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost include 
the tax trade on the Lexus?

Thanks for your help,

Kay

Kay,
The dealership will not come down on the price
for the gold and wood trim.  I have an aftermarket
company that can do both for $550.00.  Here is
a 36 month quote for the Cadillac including the
gold and wood.  Please review and let me know if you
have any questions.
