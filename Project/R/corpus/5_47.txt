Subject: Summary of Commission Meeting


In the Commission meeting today:

GridFlorida,s application to form an RTO in the Florida peninsula was 
approved with certain distinct directives. Namely, GridFlorida must improve 
stakeholder participation;  must report on further developments to ensure 
obligations of reliability and interface functions according to Order 2000; 
and must further define the rights of passive owners understanding that any 
veto rights of passive owners will be subject to review by FERC. RT01-67

Southwest Power Pool,s application to form an hybrid RTO is rejected. SPP,s 
application was limited to Entergy and SPP only and therefore, has not meant 
the scope and regional configuration as directed by Order 2000. The required 
report according to the Federal Power Act, Section 203 was not filed. The 
order does permit SPP to change its merger affiliation to join an RTO and 
approves the filing regarding the board selection process. RT01-34

FERC is issuing a Notice, RM99-2 inviting comments from the industry  on 
interregional coordination. A technical conference will be scheduled after 
comments are received. FERC has been disappointed in the filings with regard 
to the interregional participation; hence, the Notice.

CPUC v. El Paso, RP00-241. This order discusses CPUC,s complaint that El Paso 
Merchant intentionally acquired more capacity than needed to manipulate price 
spreads. The order dismisses denies summary judgment and dismisses the 
complaint. FERC stated that El Paso Merchant has not violated any standards 
of conduct. With respect to the issue of market power, the current record is 
not considered to be complete. However, FERC will schedule a hearing to 
complete and review the record.
