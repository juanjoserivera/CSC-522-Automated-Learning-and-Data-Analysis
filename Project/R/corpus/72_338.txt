Subject:	PGAS allocation to HPL

Judy, please prepare to allocated HPL's share of the PGAS project for costs through 12/31/00.  Please work with Jim Saunders as to where within HPL this is to be charged.  We will need to set up a process to charge HPL monthly for costs incurred on the project for 2001 starting with January costs until further notice.  Please call if you have any questions - x36375.
Thanks...cvb
