Hello Mark -- Andrei Postelnicu, Financial Times, will contact you regarding
the electronic trading article.  For reference, his number is 212-641-6339.

Mark, in cases where we receive similar requests in the future, may I put
reporters in contact with you directly? (with the understanding that,
depending upon the issue, you may or may not decide to speak with them) 

Also, feel free to let me know if you would like any of the ISDA staff to
join your call with Andrei. Many thanks -- Stacy
