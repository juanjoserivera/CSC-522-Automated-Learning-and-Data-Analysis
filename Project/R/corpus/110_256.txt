Hi Julie,

Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the 
book as the main source. You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock
and probably order a few more copies.

I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped
with work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.

The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night)
but we survived without major problems. The only problem I had was an overflowing 
swimming pool (it took 45 minutes to go  from a comfortable slack to a full condition).
