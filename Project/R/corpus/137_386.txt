You guys must be exhausted with all that activity.  Congratulations on the 
grandbaby.  That's a BIG deal.  My oldest "baby" is 20, a junior in college, 
and my Michael is 6.  Every age is special.

Thanks for the periodic updates about Michael.  He's in my thoughts, so I 
appreciate the info.

Thanks, Kay.  Really appreciate your efforts.  

Despite Michael's problems, we did have a pretty good year as our oldest
Son was married on September 30 and the first Joyce Grandchild was born
to our Daughter on October 24.
