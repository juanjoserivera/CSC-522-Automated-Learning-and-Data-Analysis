Diann,
	You should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed. From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved. Based on the e-mail below, I lost one week by your not having this conversation w/ a CSC rep last week. This is a week that we could not afford to lose. 

Maurice,
	Let me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item. Also, what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority?  I agree w/ you best scenario recommendation, I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates b/w the two process that you have laid out. Thanks for your help on these items.

			Ps. When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these accounts to the FTP server? Also, what time the next day can we pull the files off 
			      Of the server?

									Chris
