Hi.

Sorry we missed rehearsal Sunday, but we are definitely still "transitioning." 

We will be out of town on Sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing.  We will be at choir practice Sunday evening.

I'll look for March and April songs for the Cherubs.

The videotape of the Christmas program is cute.  Maybe we can find a time to watch it.
