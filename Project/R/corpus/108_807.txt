I bet you thought I forgot about you?!

The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the 
phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed 
form of guaranty.  We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit 
would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being 
done.  If you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees you 
need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.
