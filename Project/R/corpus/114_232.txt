All,

Please let me know by noon tomorrow if you have any issues with this 
approach.  If not, we are going to roll out this change effective close of 
business tomorrow.

Steve/Cindy, I'd suggest that we simply make this change tomorrow.  Do you 
feel the need to run it by any of the policy committee beforehand?

Kalen

Suzanne:

It is my understanding that everyone is signed off on the suggested revisions 
to the Clickathome documents relating to redeployed individuals.   Tax is.

In summary, if a person is terminated from Enron or one of its subsidiaries 
as a result of a business reorganization, the forfeiture penalty is waived.  
The amount of the waived forfeiture penalty is added to that individuals 
income as salary (imputed income) and is subject to Federal, State, and FICA 
taxes. 

V&E and I recommend that the changes are effective as of now and not 
retroactive back to the start of the plan.  A retroactive date would weaken 
the plan as it stands and take out some of the teeth that we put in at its 
inception.
