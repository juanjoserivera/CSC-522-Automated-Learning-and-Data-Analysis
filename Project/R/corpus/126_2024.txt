sorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon.
