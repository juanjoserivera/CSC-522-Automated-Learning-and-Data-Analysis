Sandra,

In response to your comments:

Section 11.1    We  cannot agree to the use of GISB's force majeure language.
Section 13.9  We will agree to suggested changes.

Finally,  warranty language would also need to be included in the GISB.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

We have reviewed your special provisions and request the following:

Section 11.1 We feel the GISB language is adequate; please delete HPL's
Section 11.1 special provision.

Section 13.9 In the fourth line change "designate an arbitrator, who need
not be neutral" to "designate a neutral arbitrator".

If you are agreeable to Dow's requested changes, please send either by
e-mail or mail originals for signature.  If you have any questions, please
give me a call.

Thanks.
