Hi Team,

I did not get much time to work on the case today - got 
pulled into a few meetings, and only just got back form 
class. BUT, tomorrow looks good... 

Jeff, Mark: can you send across what you have? Should 
we shoot for a conf call around 12:00? 

For Class 5 (i.e. second half tomorrow), didn't Sarah say 
she was going to send across a pdf file on email, or put 
something on Izio web site ? Did anyone receive this file?

-Anil
