As I said yesterday it is my understanding that we need Dynegy's permission in order to engage in such discussions.  I however have not seen the final merger documents so I may be mistaken.  Given Dynegy's presentation to the analysts on Monday it doesn't look like the want to divest of the pipes.  This is Greg's call.
