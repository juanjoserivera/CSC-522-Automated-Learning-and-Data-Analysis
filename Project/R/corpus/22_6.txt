I had mentioned to you last night that I would forward you the memo I sent my CEO of Enron yesterday.
Today seems better here, not so much anger around the trade floor.    This is our BID Week so we have alot of business to take care of.  And as of  9:11 this morning our stock is actually up slightly for the 1st time in weeks.  Hopefully,  we can close ont he Highs.
