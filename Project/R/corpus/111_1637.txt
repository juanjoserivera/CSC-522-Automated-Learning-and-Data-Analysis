Kim,

I talked to Dale early this morning and suggested that we meet during his next trip to Houston
when we decide on timing of our project.

Vince,

If Dale comes in to see you, it looks like Eric might be available to meet with you as well.  It would be a good opportunity for Eric to meet Dale and get a little more information on his model.  Eric's phone number is X54713.

Thanks, 

Kim.
