HEY!!!  Not too much time to talk.  I'm wrapping a few things up before I take the longest vacation of my life.  I may not come in tomorrow.  We will be there Saturday with bells on.  My little woman will probably need to take a nap in the back bedroom if that's ok.  Send me an email at home AND here and let me know what time to show up.  Also, she wants to know if we need to bring any snack stuff.
