What is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers 
are coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.

Later for now
