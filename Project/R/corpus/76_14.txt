I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.  I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.
