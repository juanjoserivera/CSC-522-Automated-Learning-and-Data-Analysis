Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic 
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless there 
is some reason to handle it otherwise.  

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do you 
have more copies of that document that we can attach?

Subject: RE: Exhibits to Enron South America Gas Turbine Purchase Agreemen t


Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2, this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire contract
document.


Regards,

Lee
