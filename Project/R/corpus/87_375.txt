I guess I need some more definition.    If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it, this doesn't make sense.    Can I get some definitions to go over this with Stan?   I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.    Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.   I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.    Especially at the top.
