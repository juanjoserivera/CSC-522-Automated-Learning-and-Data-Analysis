Thanks for the e-mail.  I'm excited to come visit in Nov.  However, this "bring your wallet" idea doesn't fit well with my new "I'm a cheap-skate mode". Oh well, what's a few bucks...money well spent to hang with a good buddy London.

Nov 2, or Nov 5 work fine, its upto you.  Well I've got to cut this short, Calpine is out banging on some N-M.

Cheers
KH
