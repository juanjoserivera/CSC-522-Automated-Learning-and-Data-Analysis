From my perspective the Waha, Exxon Katy Tailgate and the new Carthage Tailgate product should be converted to ENA on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur June 1st.  Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.

Thanks,

Tom
