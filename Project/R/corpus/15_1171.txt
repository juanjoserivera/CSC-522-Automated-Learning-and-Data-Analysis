Brian.   Things are pretty hectic right now.  There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.  Dynegy acquired Enron (it is so odd to say that) for its trading business and EES so I think my position is safe for the time being.  Up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work, but things have started to pick up again.  I am glad to hear that classes are going well - keep the seat next to you warm because I may be forced up there pretty soon.  Of course, now that Enron's name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good B-school.  Good luck on finals and keep in touch.
 
Your Pal,
 
Eric
