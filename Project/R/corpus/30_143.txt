It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redirect must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmission available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at least, there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TVA.  Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...
If you guys read this notice any different, please let me know.
