Emily,

Thanks for the birthday wish.  I'm still working on a good time to visit, so I'll keep you posted.  Hope all is well with you and be sure to say, "hello" to Thomas for me.  I'll shoot you an longer email when I get a chance and fill you in on all the fun stuff I've been going through around here.

Susan
