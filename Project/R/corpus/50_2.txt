You are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  

On the San Juan slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads " total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d.
