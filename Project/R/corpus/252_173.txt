There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal.
First--
All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE deal-buy tranny-etc. (I recognize this did not happen but this was my intent and should or could have). Consequently all revenue from this deal originally went into the ST-NW book. Therefore. An annuity was made from ST-NW to ST-WHOURLY. Deal #531524--$23468. Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #531546). This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a profit of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large impact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. These profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of February. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW book...ideas?
