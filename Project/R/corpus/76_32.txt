I just got the latest and greatest:

Shively
Storey
Lewis
Pimenov
Mahmassani
Williams

Assuming this is accurate, I would like to get from you, as soon as the decisions have been made, what products/regions each trader will be assigned to.  This is not only for EOL setup, but also for curve files and P&L/Position reporting.  There will be two people, not including myself to run the Central books, so I also need to begin thinking about who will be running each book.  Thanks.
