While this statement makes reference to energy, it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions.  I don't know if we have affected transactions or not.  If so, you may care about this.  My impression is that the Houston commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.  If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let Sara Shackleton or Barbara Gray know as soon as possible.
