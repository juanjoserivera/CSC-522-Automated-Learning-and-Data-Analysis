Any time you'd like to get here.  I'll be happy to set you up with a strong 
schedule.  
I'm glad you finally met Per.  He's been a little busy since I reorg'd the 
group and put him in charge.  Thanks for your patience, however.  

Jeff

Jeff,
Finally spoke to Per yesterday and we agreed to have lunch on the 26th (he's
in Houston this week and on vacation next week).  Any thoughts on my getting
down to Houston?  Hope you are well.
Nat
