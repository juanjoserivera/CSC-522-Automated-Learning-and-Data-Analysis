Hello Mr. Uutella,

Thanks for sending me the report. I have read it and I am in the process of preparing a summary of it. I  have a couple of questions for you though.

First, can you explain a little bit about the TAD technology, like how it is done and so on. Also what does TAD stand for?

Second, what does AfH stand for?

Third, the consumption numbers for all the continents were given for year 1999. Do you have them for 2000 yet?

thanks for your help,
best regards
