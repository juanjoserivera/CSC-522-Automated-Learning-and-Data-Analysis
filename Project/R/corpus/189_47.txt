      Fabienne,

     Welcome back to the case.  I am in trial myself for the rest of this 
week.  I need to speak to Bernard and you about this draft on Tuesday or 
Wednesday of next week.  Please advise the date and time that I can call 
you.  I understand that the deadline for filing is May 30.       

      Britt

     P.S.--Richard, you are more than welcome to join the conference if you 
wish.      

     P.P.S.--Becky and Lee, make sure this deadline is on my calendar 
(computer and paper) please.
