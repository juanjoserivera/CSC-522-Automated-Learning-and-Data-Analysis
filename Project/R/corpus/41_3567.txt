Hey, babe, how's things?  You get your glasses?  When we gonna get together again for a Spades massacre?

Could you order me one case of coastal cab, one of coastal zin and one of Mondavi 1997 cab?

Kisses,

PS  Last night Prentice made the most delicious porcini risotto from a veal stock that she and Cameron made!  It was truly (no kidding) incredible.
