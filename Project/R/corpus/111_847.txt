Jeff,

The newsletter is addressed to a wide audience in Enron, not
exclusively one group. We are providing forward interest rate
foreign exchange curves to multiple units of Enron
to revalue our assets. Maureen and Gwen spend
of lot of time answering questions regarding countries
like Argentina, Korea, Brazil, etc. The newsletter can
be used as a reference in answering many of those 
questions.

Vince

This report is not great.  I only like the G-7 bank info and the weekly 
economic table.  Any thoughts?  Jeff
