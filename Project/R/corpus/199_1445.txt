If at all possible, I would really appreciate postponing the tax discussion 
until your next swap group meeting, which I think is in 2 weeks.  I have 
other projects that I have to work on tonight and will not get the 
opportunity to prepare a presentation for the group before the meeting.  I 
really appreciate your asking me to speak to the group and also (hopefully) 
your understanding and patience in postponing the tax discussion.  

Best regards,
Susan
