Gerald,

Can you get with Debra on this contract I don't know why she is still jacking with this.  How's everything else going?  Oh, I called Darrin on those credit figures that will be needed for that amendment to the Kennedy Oil contract, has he called you?

Paul


PS  Our trip to Vegas isn't looking great right now!
