Mark,

 I do not know where I will be Monday (Washington, NYC, Bahamas, Houston).... 
but I would be pleased to support what looks like a good cause   otherwise. 

Thanks, Ned

 PS -  We closed $135MM  loan w/ ExImbank last friday but do not fund until 
12/21/2000.

   Meanwhile, McConnell is meeting the Prime Minister of Bahamas on the LNG 
storage facility/Pipeline to Florida this wednesday.
