Jonathan,

Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.  I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.

Your resume looks very impressive.  I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.

I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.

Best of luck,

Mark
