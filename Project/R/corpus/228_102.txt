You're e-mailing me on Greg's address book.  It's because I responded to your 
first address from his e-mail and I thought I was in my address book.

Honey,  please feel better soon.  I'm saying a prayer for you right now.  I'm 
glad I put a smile on your face (and what a handsome face it is).    Liz

 Going
forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine." - I don't understand.

I'm having a poor day.  Got to have thick skin in this business.
Hey, thinking of your beautiful "happy" smile makes me smile.  You certainly
deserve someone that brings that special kind of joy to your life.
