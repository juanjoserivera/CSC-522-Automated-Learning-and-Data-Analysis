Lloyd,
We received this from Preston.     Everyone on this distribution list would assume that EES is waiting on information from us.
We are still awaiting meaningful data from Narsimha/Preston.
I am going to discuss this with Narsimha.
I feel like a reply is warranted,  as we are making no headway on this project.

I fear for Preston if he is to work with me in the future.
