6:15 works for me.  The best way to get to my house from your house is go down Shepherd past 59 and make a right on Sunset Blvd and keep on going past Kirby and Buffalo Speedway and a couple of stop signs.  My house is on the right.  It has a witch out in the front.  The address is 3726 Sunset Blvd.

Are you still on for tomorrow?
