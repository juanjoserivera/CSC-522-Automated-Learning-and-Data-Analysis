Joannie:

Thanks
Here is the message for Jeff:



Jeff,

I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation
at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference
is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).

This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.


Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, 
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the 
agenda for the future.
