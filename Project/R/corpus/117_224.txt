We are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to Netco today.  Please look in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West and if there is a file you used to run, (price reports, the wood report, broker, desk to desk, consolidated P&L for the website, etc.) that you don't see out there now, please save a copy to this directory this morning.

Thanks

KK
