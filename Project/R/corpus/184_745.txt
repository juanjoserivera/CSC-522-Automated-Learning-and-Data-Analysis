done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?

In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.

Don't forget to book the court at the same time as the room! ----cgy
