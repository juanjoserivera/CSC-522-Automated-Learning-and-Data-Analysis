Subject:	Re: McCarty Meeting of 1/30/01   

Steve, you are right.  I'll tell you, I am so preoccupied with the Plan Restatement, Plan Upload and performance reviews that I would like to postpone a meeting with McCarty to review report format another week or so.  How do you two feel about that?  Any objections?
