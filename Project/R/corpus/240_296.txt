I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I am usually open - let me know.
