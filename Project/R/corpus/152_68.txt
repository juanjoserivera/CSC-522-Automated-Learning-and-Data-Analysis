I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you, and saw my typo!  (you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway, I'm pleased, I know he's not perfect, and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time, but if we grow and learn something from him, and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir, and we're actually proud of ourselves again, it'll work!!!!  Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light!  We've got much greater concerns right now!

Love ya!

P.S. I have a much needed hair appointment tonight, so I won't be home until real late, but I'll have my cell phone available.
