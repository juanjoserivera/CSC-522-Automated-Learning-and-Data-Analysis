Christi --

Let's talk.  

We are arguing against NERC, but Kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is Enron's approach.  Have you communicated that to Kevin?  

Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.
