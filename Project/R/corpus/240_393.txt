Yonnie,

I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!

We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!

Talk to you later -

Love,  Kim
