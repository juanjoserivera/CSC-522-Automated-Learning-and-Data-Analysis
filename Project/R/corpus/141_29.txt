Hi Dr. Leerburger,

Thanks for your feedback.  I know how busy you must be - I have three kids (7,5 and 2) so I realize how precious time off is.  I applyed to DIA, NSA and CIA about three weeks ago.  I got letters back stating my application had been recieved.  The DIA said I have been put into their applicant pool.  My company (Enron) has offered me a position in London managing a trading desk for crude oil and refined products.  They want me to move over in January or Febuary, so hopefully I'll know something before then.  If I'm not offered anything by then, I'll probably go and plan on applying to Georgetown in one to two years.  I really hope I'm offered a position now - London would be interesting - but with everything that is going on now, I'd rather start this new career now.

Thanks again for your feedback and I hope to speak with you when time permits.  If you are teaching the Threat Assesment course at AMU Spring 2002, I'll probably be in your class.

Sincerely,

Larry May
