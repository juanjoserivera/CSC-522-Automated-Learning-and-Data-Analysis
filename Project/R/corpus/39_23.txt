Hey Bruce,

The 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes.  I didn't mean to imply Cinergy wouldn't pay out; I meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects.  Startup prospects are, I think, more risky.

Also, I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston.  My "reluctance" is more of a family/moving type of thing.  It is an issue, but not a huge one.

Thanks,

Sean
