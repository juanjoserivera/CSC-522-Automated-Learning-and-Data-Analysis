Jeanne --

Not quite sure that I am getting the picture.  Let me lay it out more directly.

The PX Credit for October 2000 was $225 based on the actual market rates.

Now FERC is saying that October 2000 hourly prices for CalPX DA and CalPX HA markets were "too high" in June 2001.  Can the CPUC change the PX Credit for October 2000 and make the Utilities recalculate our Negative CTC?

What is prospective?  Have they ever done this before?
