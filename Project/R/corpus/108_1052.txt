Yep, we had a nice time.  I tried calling you about 4:00 yesterday, but there 
was no answer, so I figured you didn't want to go.

Hey, I totally forgot about last night (Sunday).  I was having my car washed
about the time I should have been thinking about getting ready.  Please
forgive me for I know it would have been a nice "do" to attend.  Did
Michelle and you have a nice time?

Thanks for going with me on Friday night.

Talk to you soon.

 Patti
