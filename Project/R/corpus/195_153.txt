so i talked to bryan last night...after a few ritas and beers.  supposedly we're going to do something tonight.  very curious how this will all pan out.  i do kind of feel "old" around him.  not because he's immature or anything of that nature, but because i've been out and working for 2 yrs now and he's living at home with his parents and planning on going back to school...just feel like i'm in a very different place.  of course, as usual, i'm giving this way too much thought.

really wanted to go to the firehouse...maybe i can tell him i have to be home early and i could meet you (and Katy) there later?  i'm so bad.
