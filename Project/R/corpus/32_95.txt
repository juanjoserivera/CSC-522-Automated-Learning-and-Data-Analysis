Jim,
 
I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College
   3- University of Massachusetts
   4- Bocconi University (Italy)
 
Thanks,
Monika
