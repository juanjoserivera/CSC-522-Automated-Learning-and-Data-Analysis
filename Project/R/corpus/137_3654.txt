Ben:

Substantive revisions were made (changing the earnest money concept to a
development fee concept, more complete termination provisions, replacing
confidentiality provisions with reference to a confidentiality agreement,
elimination of provisions addressing mediation) and the prototype documents
were recirculated on 12/15/2000.  However, the 12/15/2000 drafts of the
documents make specific references to NRG Thermal and contain specific dates
that would no longer be relevant.  We would recommend further revision to
address these matters before circulating for another potential transaction.
