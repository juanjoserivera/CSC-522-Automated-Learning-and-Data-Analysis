Kevin,

We have over 400 books that were getting officialized at that time.  I tried to get from everyone which post-id's they used that day from Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with that many books we are bound to get a wrong post-id or miss one.  I need to get the list from credit or RAC to be sure we have the right information.  I have yet to hear from them today. 
I also told Z to run with what he had and I'll get with him asap if I find it was wrong.

Thanks
Kam
