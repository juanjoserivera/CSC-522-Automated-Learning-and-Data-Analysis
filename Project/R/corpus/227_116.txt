Thanks for the offer, but I can't get away that early without taking vacation time.  At this point my flight gets in at 8:36 p.m.

I'm afraid Amanda's friends will be disappointed.  The two-step, a polka or maybe a C&W line dance is more in the Texas line; they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable.
