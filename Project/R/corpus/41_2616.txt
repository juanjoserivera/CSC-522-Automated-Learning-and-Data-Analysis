That's fine if you don't want to do the road, but please tell Eldon and I'll 
tell Jeff (my road guy).

We really cannot do the road at this point. 

Amber's address:? 25664 Carmel Knolls Road, Carmel, CA 93923.? She is 20 
years old on Sunday!. 

I wrote you because I am not sure if Prentice is getting e-mails. 

Remember that some of your stuff might still be outside if I don't remember 
to bring it in.? There is also a folder of pick sheets to take up to the dome 
and leave on my desk, so we have them when any of us are up there.
