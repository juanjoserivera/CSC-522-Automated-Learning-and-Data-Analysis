That reminds me.  There used to be a "gift department" that blessed such 
things.  I don't remember where it is - PR?  I wonder who would know?

I can't wait to use the "baby Carnahan" things!  It makes me excited just to 
think about it.  And funny you would mention the last name thing because I 
was just thinking about that last night.  The father's name is Dustin Elkins, 
but I doubt they will get married (at least Shayne has not indicated that 
they were).  Kayne reminds me of my niece and nephew's names (Kade and Konner 
Carnahan).  

I just talked to Carlos.  He is already in Colorado and in the process of 
renting a car.  I told him about the gift thing and he does not think it 
would be a problem.  The deal is, that the Indian Chief that Matt Gimble has 
been dealing with was ousted and so Matt, et al. want to give the "new" Chief 
a saddle and maybe a fishing real.  They also want to give the 4 tribal 
counsel and their attorney pen & pencil sets and shirts.

Anyway, Carlos did not think it would be a problem but asked me to double 
check with Andy Edison just in case.

How embarrassing to be stripped of chiefhood!  I'll bet ole' Chief Sitting 
Bull is turning over in his grave!
