Peter,

Enron South America has nothing to do with COA.  Enron North America is the 
assignee.  

As for payments, we can state that as of the signing of the agreements, all 
payments have been made.  Sounds ok to me.

Subject: RE: Information Needed for City of Austin

Is Enron South America the assignee for the City of Austin deal?  If so,
I need its place of incorporation and location of its ofices.  As to the
exhibits, I believe most can be copied.  However, at least Exhibit N-3
is deal specific and will list the purchase amount for aech unit for the
calculation of the unit liability amount.  If the November payment has
been made, then the turbines for the City of Austin have been completely
paid for. Should I just put Not Used for Section 6.1.2?
