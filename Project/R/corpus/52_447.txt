Mohammad,

What's going on? Hope all you exams went well. Are you coming home for the holidays? If so give me a shout in the office, at home or in Red Deer. Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.

Chris
