The value in the table is the beginning balance for each month.  So if they 
cancel in the middle of the month, they should pay the balance at the 
beginning of that month and no prorated minimum monthly fee.  If you prorate 
it on both ends, you end up getting the total balance shown at the beginning 
of the month.
