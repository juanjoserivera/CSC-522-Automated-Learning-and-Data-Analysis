John:
My fault.  It should say "succeeding Scheduled Payment Date" and Scheduled 
Payment Date is defined in Section 14 of the ISDA form.  As far as choice of 
law, we can go with NY although I disagree with your counsel, in that in 
order for the New York choice of law to be enforced by a court, the parties 
have to demonstrate some minimum relationship with the jurisdiction chose.

Carol - two issues:  First, dealing with the applicable law, you can see
from the copies message below, from our legal counsel, that we will not
accept Texas law.  Second, I looked through my ISDA booklets and cannot find
that term "Succeeding Payment Date" defined anywhere.  Can you specify where
it is defined?

Answer from Legal:
We will not accept Texas law as the governing law over the ISDA. All of El
Paso's ISDA's are governed by New York law. The ISDA was created under NY
law by NY financial practitioners. There is substantial case law for ISDA's
using New York Law. The User's Guides reference NY case law. You do not have
to have a contact in New York. New York is not the venue, it is the
governing law.

Arbitration may be held in Houston, Texas, using New York law.
