                  "We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not
                  the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of
                  gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we 
satisfied
                  our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally
                  supplied." (Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre) 

                  Did you know?
                  "Ambrosia" literally means "immortality" in Greek; it is a
                  derivative of the Greek word "ambrotos," meaning "immortal,"
                  which combines the prefix "a-" (meaning "not") with 
"-mbrotos"
                  (meaning "mortal"). In Greek and Roman mythology, only
                  immortals -- gods and goddesses -- could eat ambrosia. Those
                  mythological gods and goddesses also drank "nectar," which, 
in
                  its original sense, refers to the "drink of the gods." 
(Even today,
                  you'll often find the words "ambrosia" and "nectar" in each
                  other's company.) While the "ambrosia" of the gods prevented
                  death, we mere mortals use "ambrosia" in reference to things
                  that just taste or smell especially delicious.
