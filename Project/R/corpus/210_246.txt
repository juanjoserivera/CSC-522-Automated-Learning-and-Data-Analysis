Mo,

Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  Hope to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.    

Mat
