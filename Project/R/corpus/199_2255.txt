Caroline:

I haven't spoken with Frank in several days.  You may want to ask Holly (his former assistant) for a number to just say hello.  He seems to be doing a little better each day.  Can we set up a call later today and I'll try to fill you in as much as I can?  There is a developing process and I'll tell you how it is supposed to work.  I have a meeting in at 2:30 Houston time so I'll call you in a few minutes or afterwards.

Sara
