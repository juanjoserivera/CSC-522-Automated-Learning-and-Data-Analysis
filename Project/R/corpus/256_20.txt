Keith,
I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these
respective meters on NWPL:

Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472
Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446
Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227
Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302

Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not
nominate through the Cascade LDC?
This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.

Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the
above plants closed or reduced capacity.

I appreciate any help you can give me.
Thanks,
