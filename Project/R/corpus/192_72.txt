Hi!  It has been a long time!  As you know things here are very shaky.  I can't believe the big E has crumbled!  Who would have ever guessed!  Everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.  I'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together!  And we need to!  I'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon. So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.  Any chance of you and Mark coming down?  We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welcome.  I love your house!  Thanks for sending the picture.  Its so exciting but its also a lot of work!  I'm glad I'm done!  It's nice to be in the house, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards!  Its very strange, but what to do?  Natalie, I can't believe is 3!  And a very terrible 3.  My hands are full!  I'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter.  She quite the daring child, so I think she'll enjoy.  Ask Mark for me if this is too young.  She won't think so, its mostly my fear. =)  You'll get a kick of the pictures I've attached.  One of them is my depiction a young Penny Lane. Hopefully you saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!  You'll also notice the Beagle that Bill bought for Natalie.  HAHA! His name is Presley.  She's absolutely in love with him. 

Keep in touch!
Diana
