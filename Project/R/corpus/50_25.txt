Tracy had suggested that we leave the Marketing Strategy to the end after we put together the 10 year plan so that we could address how we plan to meet it.  I had included in my drafts to Kevin the Mktg Strategy slides (2) from our 2002 stuff, but we probably need to expand that to address expansions etc, but I was waiting until we finalized what we were going to project in the 10 year plan.  The strategy should be the same for the Rating Agency slide bullets as for the Business Plan Text.
