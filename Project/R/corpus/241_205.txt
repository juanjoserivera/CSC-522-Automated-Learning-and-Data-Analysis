That price indication does reflect the time value of money - so - if bought - power in 2001 would be billed at $61/MWh.

Kim

Thank you so much! That is quite useful information.

Question relevant to longer-term quotes...are those cash-flow year
"settlement" prices (in other words, if a deal was done today for on-peak
power in the year 2011, would an invoice in the year 2011 be settled at
$61/mwh, or would that price somehow need to be adjusted to reflect
inflation).
