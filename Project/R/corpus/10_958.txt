I'm running out the door to go drinking with the boys at front porch, right next to my apartment.  

I don't think your dad would like me so much.  Will explain later.

Sorry about your day.  Maybe you can find some happiness in the book of prayers.  Maybe you can find more happiness in the money.

Talk to you later.
