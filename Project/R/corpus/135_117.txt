The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.  Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!

Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!
