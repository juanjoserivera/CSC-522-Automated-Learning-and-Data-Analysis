Ron,

We are really swamped and I would like to keep our involvement in
conferences to a reasonable minimum. I can promise that we shall help you
with a future conference if it happens to be in Houston.

Vince,

I am sorry you can't join us.  Is there someone on your staff who might be
able to do the presentation "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation,"
scheduled for Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.?
