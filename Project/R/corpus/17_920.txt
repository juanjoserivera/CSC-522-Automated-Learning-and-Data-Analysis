Thanks so much for your note.  I have assumed my new role as COO right at budget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under Enron Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.  The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!

Your association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.  CIndy is keeping me abreast of your project.  I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you.  

While everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in New York.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  --Sally
