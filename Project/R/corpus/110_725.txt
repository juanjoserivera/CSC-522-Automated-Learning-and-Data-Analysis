Peter,

Thanks for your words of comfort. The higher you fly, the harder you crash.
Books will be written about this company.

I don't worry too much about myself. I have about fifty employees in
Houston and 10 in London who need help. I am trying to find jobs
for them using my contacts in the industry. 

Personally, I have many options that have come up in the last few days but everything is
on hold for the time being till uncertainty is resolved here  at Enron.

Vince
