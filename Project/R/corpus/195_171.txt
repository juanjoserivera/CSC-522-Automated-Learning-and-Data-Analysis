She lives!!!!  I know it's been ages since we've caught up on each other's lives.  I'm anxious to hear what's happening in yours in the upcoming months.  I'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk.  As for a visit, you know I'm always up for a trip out to the coast.  I'm actually heading to Seattle next weekend with a friend from work and then August is going to be filled with a trip to Denver (work related...I know tough) and a visit to S. Korea to see Chris and Chuck for a week and a half or so.  I'm really excited about that trip...I think we're going to try and take a weekend jaunt somewhere like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing while I'm there.  So given all of that, what are your thoughts on Labor day weekend?  It's the first weekend of September...automatic 3 day weekend for me, so I could fly in around the same time I did on my last visit that Friday and leave Monday afternoon.  Let me know if that sounds good, or if there's some other weekend you had in mind.  

You'll have to tell both of the Eric's and Clint I said, "Hello."  I had such a great time hanging out with all of them, and your cousin too.  You attract very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent company.  By the way, how are things in regards to Clint...still just good hang-out buddies?  I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email that things with Brendan are still good and if so, I'm glad for you.  

I went shopping at Stein Mart recently too and found some really cute things, I absolutely love that store.  And, I'm honored to be your shopping muse.

Love,
Susan

PS - The job's still good and I miss you too.
