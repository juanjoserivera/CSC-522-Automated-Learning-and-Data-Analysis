Kay,

is this what you meant?

Consistent with the results of the Feasibility and Facilities Studies and 
discussions that have been held to date between Florida Power & Light Company 
(&FPL8) and Midway Development Company, L.L.C (& Midway and its designees 
referred to as &MDC8), by this letter MDC authorizes FPL to perform the 
necessary studies, analysis and other activities required to develop and 
support a schedule the necessary for a potential power project to 
interconnect with FPL,s transmission grid system and receive back-feed by 
March 15, 2002. 

Does this letter get the "Oricle's" seal of approval?  

If Ben needs to sign this, would it be ok if he faxed it to FPL?
