Megan, 

We didn't operate HPL in a way where we matched markets with specific supplies.  The supply for these sales was the entire HPL system.  You can calculate the WACOG on HPL as an estimated cost for each day or month.  But I can't give you a specific supply cost or deal.  Let me know if you have any questions.
