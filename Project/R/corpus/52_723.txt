Tamara,

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give you a call then.
