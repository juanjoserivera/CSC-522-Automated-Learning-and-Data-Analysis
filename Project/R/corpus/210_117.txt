Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate 
degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.

Subject: RE: HR Position

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.
