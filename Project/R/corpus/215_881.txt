We should the testimony at FERC in the ARTO docket.  By pushing FERC to get with the program and by pushing ARTO to use a better CM model, we'll get leverage.  Taking it to the PUCO is a nice step, but I don't think that they are going to change the current ARTO program.  

By the way, where is the PUCO on ARTO / MISO issues?

Thanks,
