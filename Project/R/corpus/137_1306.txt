John,

I've received internal approval to participate.  I'll see what I can come up 
with for a bio.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: RE: Roundtable

Dear Kay, I was delighted to hear from John Keffer that, subject to
receiving internal approvals, you would be joining us for our Roundtable
discussion on Thursday. When you get the necessary approvals could you
please send me your bio so that we can make sure you get due credit in The
Texas Lawyer? Many thanks, John C.
