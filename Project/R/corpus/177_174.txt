did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about.  my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one of those guys.  

just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too?  

i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.
