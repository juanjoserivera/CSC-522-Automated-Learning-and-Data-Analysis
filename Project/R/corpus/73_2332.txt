Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.  We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.  You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.
 
Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.  I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me.
