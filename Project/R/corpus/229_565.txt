No, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs 
trades in the relevant commodities.  In fact, we used that language to 
mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms 
when they first signed up for EnronOnline.  To the extent we want to 
eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their 
agreement.  

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms 
for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or 
not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will 
leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you 
might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up 
for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally 
available......

Question:

Does the ETA trump any language in an existing ISDA regarding the signed 
confirm being the governing doc for a trade ?
