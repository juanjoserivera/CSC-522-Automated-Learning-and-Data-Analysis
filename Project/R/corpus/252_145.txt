Jill,
I was being sarcastic about the $16000. Could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 3 months (AT&T should have this info). If you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well. I am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent.
I appreciate the help.

Thanks,
Bill
