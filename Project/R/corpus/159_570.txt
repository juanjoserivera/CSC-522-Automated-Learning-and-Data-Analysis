Same stuff going on here.  Lisa and I are still settling things.  Looks like 
I am going to keep the house.  So you need to come into town and well have a 
good time.

My address is:    1403 Banks
  Houston, Texas 77006

I am hooked up with tickets to the Big 12 game.  Are you guys still planning 
on a bus to SA?
