Karen,

I don't run across many people without email these days. Big hassle.  It is 
so much easier to check for certain issues with an electronic copy.

I'm looking for the Fehr option, but the latest I have on my computer is the 
version I emailed to you on August 30th.  Is there a more up-to-date version, 
and if so, could you please mail it to me?

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: RE: Yorkville Annexation Agreement

Kay:
The Village's attorney drafted the agreement and therefore we do not have an
electronic version -- unfortunately, he does not have email either.  The
redlined version you are reviewing now reflects only minor changes from that
originally executed by ENA approximately a month ago.  Please let me know if
I can be of any assistance.  Thanks!
