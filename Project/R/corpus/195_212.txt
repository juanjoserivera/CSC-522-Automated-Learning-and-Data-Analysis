Paul,

So nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going great for you as well.  I'm actually going Laura Jahnke's wedding that same evening.  Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.  Please tell Nathan I say, "hello" and wish he and his new wife the very best.  So when does school start?  And, how are the small businesses going?

Have a nice time at the wedding,
Susan
