Billy,

We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.

He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
complain that the question is too detailed.


He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).
