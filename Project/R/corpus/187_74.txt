jeese, we don't have to leave this place just bc my trading profits are in a death spiral.  i can always stay here and bake cakes at the omni till you are ready to leave.  and then of course we have to consult the dogs and see what their schedule looks like.  ugh---this day is so bad.  i feel so helpless it just sucks.   i will give you a call when i head out to the hpy hr...did you get my message about AK?
talk to you later.
