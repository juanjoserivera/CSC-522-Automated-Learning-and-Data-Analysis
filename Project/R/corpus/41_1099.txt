Don't even worry about it.  Thanks for being sensitive to the issue. Good to 
see you guys this weekend, despite all the excitement.

Best,
Jeff

I didn't get this e-mail until today  (I mean I hadn't downloaded anything
for a couple of days and therefore didn't even know it was there).  If I had
seen it, I wouldn't have made the comments I made at the dome about wanting
to hear what you had to say about the very things you specified in your
e-mail you didn't want to hear.  You must have thought I was deliberately
going against your wishes and I apologize for that.  If you remember, the
last time we had talked about the problem re energy, you were not reluctant
to discuss it so I thought something had happened at the dome that needed to
be straightened out.  So, as I stated above, if I had seen your e-mail
before going to the dome, I would have understood what was going on.
