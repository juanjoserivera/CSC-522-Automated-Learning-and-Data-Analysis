Quite frankly I am getting tired of memos like this!  There has not been a decision not to provide short-term liquidity for Enron Wind.  If there was I would have called.  Enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.  I need the support of the entire team as does Enron to help us get through this.  I need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that Wind can help.  I need cost reductions, improved cash flow and SUPPORT.

Thank you!
