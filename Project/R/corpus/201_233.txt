Thanks for the update.  Is there another piece (external attachment) needed 
for web use?  Sounds like you are doing well.  

Regards,

Subject: New Pocket PC - iPAC

Dear Mr. Shankman,

Philippe Bibi, Chief Technology Officer of Enron Networks, has purchased for 
your use a pocket PC by Compaq called &the iPAQ8.  This device allows you to 
leave the desktop behind and remotely
? Read e-mail
? View attachments and stay productive anywhere. 
? Take the Internet and important information with you. 
? Record voice messages 

The device has high-resolution color display which gives you easy screen 
viewing and sharp, brilliant clarity in any light.  Please refer to the 
attached web address for additional functionality <

My name is LaMetrice Dopson, Director of Customer Service.  I will be 
responsible for ensuring that this device is quickly and appropriately 
installed in your environment.  To maximize the functionality of the device, 
we would like to expedite the installation of Window 2000 on your desktop.  
In order to do this, I will schedule a time with your executive assistant to 
survey your desktop and identify the applications that you utilize.  This 
information will ensure the appropriate configuration is implemented for your 
environment.  This will also require converting your assistant to Windows 
2000.

Please inform your assistant if you are interested in having this device 
installed. I will contact her by the next business day.   At that time, I 
will send out additional information of what you can expect to receive with 
the installation.  

This is a great user-friendly tool to have.  I look forward to working with 
you.
