Kirk,
As I am just catching up, I am not the one for storage and transportation issues as i do not trade them on a regular basis.
I was under the impression i was working on the options and futures. Yes there has not been any meeting with me for the past two weeks.  As for the conversion and arbitrage problems let me know , I am not sure what these are but am will to help.
