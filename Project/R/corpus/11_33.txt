VOM - I think we did $2, Brandon should be able to confirm, I know it was 7x24, with 8 hour min run
Re size - our interest is atmost 250 MW
 
Capacity in the ECAR market is important from a reliability aspect.  For example we could sell totally synthetic tolls and they would not be as valuable as the toll  off a plant in the region. Thats where the capacity comes into play. Moreover as RTOs come in, there might be an explicit ICAP market for ECAR.
