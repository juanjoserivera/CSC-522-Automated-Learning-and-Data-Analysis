I'd still like to play tennis sometime.  I don't have the time nor the money to play much golf.

Speaking of golf and your predictions, would you like to wager on your goal of 70's by Dec '02.  I'll bet you right now at $10 a stroke over/under 80 on a reasonable course (par 72 etc)  of your choice in Houston next December.   :-)
