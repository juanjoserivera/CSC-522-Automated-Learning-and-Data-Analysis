It was only a draft.  The commission has to vote it out for it to become 
effective.  They've delayed doing that.  Therefore it's status quo on the 
SoCalGas system.

Jeff - I read this in Com. Bilas' draft final opinion. Are you saying that 
the draft final opinion was never truly final? 

I am looking for the windowing process and how intrastate capacity is 
allocated. Any suggestions?
