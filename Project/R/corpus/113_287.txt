Thank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of "my Enron."  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best.
