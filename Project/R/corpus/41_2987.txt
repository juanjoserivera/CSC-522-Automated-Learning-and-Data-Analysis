I just got it.  I'll fax it.  Trying to read, but am currently reading the latest version of SB 78, which we just got and Scott has faxed.  Jim, here's the latest.  It's going to be heard this afternoon, per Scott's note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether Davis will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (Edison bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  Will report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.

Best,
Jeff
