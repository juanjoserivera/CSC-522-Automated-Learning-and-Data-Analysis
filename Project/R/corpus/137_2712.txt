Here's what I got from Eric on the lease.  The numbers don't seem to match, but we won't worry about that now.

The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday. 

Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.  To the extent necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial questions.  We won't tackle the security agreement or the license agreement yet. Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).

Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.  If the docs aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any additional expense.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until things become a bit more clear.  

Thanks,

Kay
