I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  Sara
