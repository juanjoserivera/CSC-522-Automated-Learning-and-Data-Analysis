Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 
1.  it is more conservative
2.  the difference is small
3.  that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.

If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.

Thanks
