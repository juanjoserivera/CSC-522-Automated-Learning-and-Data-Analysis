Please see exchange below.  Can you send me current plans - who, when, where and what - for London reviews?  I would put a several day moratorium on contacting London regarding upcoming Doorstep review plans until I get back with you.  Thanks.  --Sally 

I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.  What happened to that effort?  Sounds as if from the London e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world.
