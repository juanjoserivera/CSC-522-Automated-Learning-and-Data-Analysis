Hey "G",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me, I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.  Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya
