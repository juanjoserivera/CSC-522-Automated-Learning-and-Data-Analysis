real meaning real acacia.  don't care about labeling.  what would you compare 
to in quality?  seems to me that one can't beat $5/bottle for acacia, non?  
what cheese?  man, you saw a great game.  i was portland for the past couple 
days, saw some of the game yesterday at the airport (plane was delayed).

GO GIANTS!

How real do you need?  It is Acacia chard that was supposed to be special 
labeled which means it was done for a restaurant or some special client and 
some of the deals fell through!  It's not the best but it is very good 
especially for the price!  Are you going with PP to do the cheese or does the 
cheese shopper stand alone?
