Eldon said that you were making dinner on Friday, the 9th, and that he was 
flying a plane to pick up Cameron and Rory in Carmel.  Have you guys spoken 
in the last few months!?!?!?  (kidding.)  And don't worry about my 
birthday--that's not the issue.  It's Eldon's 80th--that's huge.  Friday is 
the 9th.  So I'm just checking in to see what's up.  My very strong 
inclination--for a variety of reasons, but Eldon's b-day is the biggest 
one--is to cancel.

Signed,
confused

I'm not sure what Friday will bring - the party as you know (for you and 
Eldon as far as I am concerned) is on Saturday - however, none of your 
friends will be there except us!  When would you normally get back?
