Looks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).
