David,

Thanks for sending this to me, it looks good.  Does Mr. Frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed ?  I would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient, but he probably needs the back ground just in case.

Let me know if I can do anything to help.

Regards,

Jon
