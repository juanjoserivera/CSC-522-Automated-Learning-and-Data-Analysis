Hi Michelle -
 
It looks as though this will work quite easily now as the breakfast Ken originally had scheduled will not take place.  I received word from Sue Landwehr that it will be cancelled as it was Republican Governors and they will not now be here.  We'll coordinate an exact time tomorrow.
 
Thanks.
 
Rosie
