Helllllooooo Aunt,

I'm on my way to Houston tomorrow.  I've sold the China cabinets, but not the TV cabinet. (Still working on it!)  Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.  I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.  I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.   I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.


Love

Jon
