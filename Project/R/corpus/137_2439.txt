Subject: RE: CPCN proceeding - AG intervention

the first step would be to object to the party making the request.  If the
parties cannot work it out as between themselves, the one with the objection
can appeal to the Commission.  I don't believe it would weaken our position
to have released the information to the Public Staff for some of the same
reasons I suggested earlier--particularly the facts that the Public Staff
and the AG have a statutory obligation to represent the public,and are not a
profit-making entity, and neither    would be able to misuse proprietary
information, as NCNG would.
