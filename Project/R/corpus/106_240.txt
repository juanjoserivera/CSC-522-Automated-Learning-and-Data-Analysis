Michael,
 I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two changes 
which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are signing.  
These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001 and the left 
over reference to Alberta be deleted from Enron North America Corp.'s 
address.  I will attach Transaction No. 1 to the Assignment Document and have 
it executed by Enron.  If you will provide me with the fax numbers for each 
party, I will fax to these numbers.  My fax number is (713)646-3490.
