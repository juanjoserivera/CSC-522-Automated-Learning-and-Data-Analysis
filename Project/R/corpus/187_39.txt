Hey there,
Sorry we missed you on Easter.  We had been doing so much driving and still had to go to my moms.  John is actually out of town this weekend.  I will be going to my mom's sat night for dinner.  Maybe there is a time i can meet up w/ you before or after?  Hope all is well.  
I'll be in town for the next 3 weekends as john will be doing a bit of travel.  Drop me a line if you want to do anything.
Talk to ya later,
Mo
