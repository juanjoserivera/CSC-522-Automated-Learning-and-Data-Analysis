Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you liked the pictures.  We would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.  If you thought it would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner together.  I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday night before heading to Amanda's recital.  Then you could make your drive back on Wednesday after breakfast.  
Whatever works for you will be great, though.  

I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League National meeting.  Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.  My Thursday night is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.  She lives in Whittier, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.  I know that we will have a good time catching up.
