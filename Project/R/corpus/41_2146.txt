Thanks.  I'll get you one more name then.  

FYI:  To use a Kaufman phrase, "I'm a little frosted."  I'm on a litigation 
call, on which I mentioned the Plan B (which I got only because I searched 
out Scott Governor yesterday).  On the call Sandi said, "Jeff, there's a 
response from the Governor to the Plan B, which I faxed to Steffes 
yesterday."  I want you to know that I took a deep breath, and asked Sandi to 
fax it to the San Francisco office.  Unreal....

Best,
Jeff

Looks good.  You don't need to list me; you get me for free.
