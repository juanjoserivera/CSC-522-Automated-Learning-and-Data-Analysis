Sara:  Thanks for the revised schedule and comments.  I will be reviewing
and discussing them with EWEB tomorrow (Friday, 12/22).  In the meantime,
attached for your review is our draft form of legal opinion resulting from
our discussion last week.

Perhaps we can arrange time for a conference call on Tuesday, 12/26/00, to
finalize our negotiations?

-Jim
