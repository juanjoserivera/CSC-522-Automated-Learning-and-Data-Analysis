I checked and Sara sent a message to Credit on 3/26/01 but obviously has had no response.  You may want to respond to Mr. Martin and let him know that Sara did receive his message and that we were waiting on our Credit Department to respond and we will send them (Credit) another reminder that we are waiting to hear from them.
