Rod,
    I'd love to queue up a discussion about CMS and/or WMB, so that the Board is thinking "large acquisition".  I just don't know if we'll be ready.  I've talked with Whalley, and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident.  Also, Greg wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow.  Therefore, I'd like to start getting Tim DeSpain involved.  Does that make sense?
