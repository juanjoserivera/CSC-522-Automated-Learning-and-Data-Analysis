Margaret,

I do wish to renew my visa, however, the system has deleted your previous e-mail containing the questionnaire.  Could you please resend this and a list of other requirements.  I will turn the paper work around in 24 hours.

I am unsure how to respond to the following questions:

	6.   U.S. Alien registration number.....unsure what this is

	7.   Address outside U.S....................I have severed Canadian residency for tax purposes.  Can I answer N/A?

	11. Complete legal name and address of Enron affiliate......similar to #7.  I have severed all ties to Canada, including Enron Canada.

	Entire section on "Current postino abroad"....similar issue as described in #11.


Sorry for the inconvience this has caused.

Thanks
Keith
