Mark, 
     I hate losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.  So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.  Thanks.
 
Dan
