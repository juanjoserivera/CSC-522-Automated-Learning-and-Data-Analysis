I've called Eric Thode in our Houston office and if he's successful, there 
will be something in the trade press about this issue soon.

Subject: RE: Questions you requested



 This excellent material, and very important, but it's pretty
esoteric.  If you want to really kick the ISO and Davis in the shins, use
Mary's stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB.   Assuming
it's true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission
route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power, and that this raised the
market price in the NW by about $50-75 per megawatt-hour, and that this is
costing the NW $2-5 million per day (at least for the period that Mary
looked at), that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit.  If we can
establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Davis's handpicked
ISO board, the NW Senators will escape Earth's gravitational pull.  For that
very reason, we have to be able to back up anything we say, and we need to
anticipate any defenses the ISO may have.  But if you want NW elected
officials to quit being so polite toward Davis, that will do it.
