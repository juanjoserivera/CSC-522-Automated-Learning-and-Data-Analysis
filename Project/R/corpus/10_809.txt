John:
Here is my analysis of my guys:
Mike Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he has run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations.  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Required to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop John Griffith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' elses positions.  Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot function without one of us on the desk.  
Computer causing problems.  will email with other guys later.
