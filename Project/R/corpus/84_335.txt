Mary: 
This is complicated for oil companies.  Mobil Exxon only does hedging.  Shell 
has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly 
trading for profit.  BP Amoco is sort of in between.  It is very clear with 
respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary.  The 
companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging 
organization send in the application.  
Let me know if you need other info.

This is the response I received from Shell when I requested that they
reapply at the Primary level.

I did tell him that there will be some energy/gas companies in the
Subscriber category who will be asked to move to the Primary category in
2001.  Those were firms that were members before we made the by-law change
to 'solely'.

I am of the thinking that in addition to Cargill, El Paso Energy and TXU
Europe Power, we would also ask BP Amoco and Mobil Exxon to all move to
Primary.  

Any suggestions...

Thanks,
Mary
