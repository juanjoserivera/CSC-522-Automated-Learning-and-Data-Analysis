I saw that, unbelievable huh?  The sad thing is that the folks I work with never heard of Jack Kerouac nor "On the Road".  
Probably not surprising considering most are from Texas.  How's everything going?  Did you get an opportunity to call
Kampy.  How's the job search progressing?

Before I forget, was there a guy in our MBA class named Chris Sevrson or something like that?  An email was forwarded
to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar.  

Any big plans for the weekend?  We're just hanging around Houston.  It seems every weekend for the past year+ we've
been doing some type of house work.  Hopefully one day it will slow.  Talk to you soon.
