Lined against 3 sounds good.  Circulate to me, Bill, Dale, Lee, Kent

Subject: RE: LV Cogen Turbine Agreement

Once these changes are made (on Version 5) and the changes received from
the contractor (currently in Version 4) are removed, do you want me to
circulate a blackline against Version 3, which I believe was the last
version seen by Lee Johnson? If so, who do you want to receive copies of
Version 5 of the LV Cogen Agreement?
