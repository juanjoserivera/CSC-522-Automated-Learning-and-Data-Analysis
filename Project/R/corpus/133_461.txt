can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.
