Yes, by Skilling mostly.  I can't believe that a handful of people brought the company all the way down to the point of bankruptcy.  Basically, they took all the money that the core businesses made and pissed it all away in poor investments (broadband, India, Azurix, etc...)  I just hope I have a job thru the holidays.  I feel vulnerable because I'm the new one in this group.  I would feel more secure if I was still in risk.  Oh well, I guess it's wait and see.
