The deal with the Banks is being held up by Paribas to get a cross-netting agreement with Enron.   I understand we have agreed and the documentation could be done as early as today.   Bill Bradford is working on this one.   So it's up to Enron to fix the problem at this point in time.   PAribas releases and we get the agreement in place and we can start moving these LC's.
