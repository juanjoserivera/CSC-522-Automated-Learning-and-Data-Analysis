I do play guitar, but I am really still just learning.  I can play bit and 
pieces of various songs.  Might be fun to attempt to jam together anyway.  
Are your drums here in Houston?

It's going great!
I told my folks as well and they were pretty surprised.  Houston has been
good to us so far.  Although I have been working my butt off, so I haven't
seen much of it.  I heard you play the guitar.  We could have a little
partridge family band because I play the drums.  Anyway I have been itching
to play for about 3 years (I have been in apartments for that long), so we
should get together and jam if you are interested.
I'll talk to you later,
-Kevin
