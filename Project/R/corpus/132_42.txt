We're still refining the post-Red Rock regulatory rate base and won't know the offset until sometime tomorrow pm.  The same theory would apply to TW - if you don't collect a tax component, you would not have a rate base reduction for deferred taxes.  We should know by Friday morning what the net impact of eliminating the tax component and deferred taxes has on TW's rates.  I'm still not sure the tax component should be eliminated - Hope to understand more after Monday's meeting with tax.
