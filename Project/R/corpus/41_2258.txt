I don't recall Lay saying that the increase should apply to DA customers.  We 
should discuss further just to make sure that we're all on the same page.

Best,

Harry, Marty Sunde, Jeff Dasovich and I were on a trip with Ken Lay last 
week.  I understood from Marty that Ken may believe that all customers, 
including direct access, should pay the increase you mention.  Marty?  This 
was encouraging from a litigation exposure standpoint because, to the extent 
all consumers are treated alike, our DA customers who were resourced to 
utility service cannot claim to have been disadvantaged by our action.  The 
converse is also true:  if they have to pay because they were put back on 
utility service they may try to pass that cost through to us.  To the extent 
that any increase is to pay back DWR for buying power 2/1/01-3/31/02, and 
those on DA are not required to pay this, EES could have a substantial 
exposure to its customers.   Maybe we need to modify our strategy to take 
this into account.
