My bad...it's not Luke.  I just called and I think they said the Hollisters.  Anyway, the Radney Foster gig is extremely tempting but I really need to see my sister and the kids...depending on what Corey has to say though, I may just go to Austin Sunday and Monday.  We'll see.  Give me a buzz or drop a line if you want to get together.
