I spoke to Rick McCombs at Mayer Brown this morning and he informed me that he is in trial all week and unavailable for a call today. We agreed to a 7am central (1pm London and 8am New York) call on Thurs. to go over the answer and any other pending items. He promised a draft answer by  3 pm central on Wed afternoon. Hopefully, Paul will be well by then. I will set up a call-in number for the conference..
