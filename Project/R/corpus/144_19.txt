Ken, 

As discussed in our conversation this afternoon, attached is a draft copy of 
a presentation that was created as an internal briefing document on the 
business activities within EGM.  The purpose of this presentation is to 
communicate our activities and provide individuals with a more detailed 
reference document on these businesses in case they come up in Q&A.

This is a confidential and internal document, which includes earnings 
targets, goals and objectives.  We have a shorter more external version that 
we use to describe our businesses.  I can provide that copy if you are 
interested.

Please don,t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like 
to discuss this in more detail.  

Mike 

PS - I will also send this to Jeff, IR and PR
