The NYMEX may require the aggregation of any employees NYMEX trading with the 
trades of the company.  In addition, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees 
from trading products that the company trades, which includes NYMEX crude.  
In the future, please do not trade this product, or any products that the 
company trades.  If you have any questions about any specific products, 
please call me, Ted Murphy or Mark Taylor. 

By copy of this email, I am also notifying Ted Murphy with the Control Group, 
and Mark Taylor, VP and Assistant General Counsel of Trading.

Subject: Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions 
for ENA,s NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications 
require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents 
have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any other 
related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with 
another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany 
email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business Friday, June 30, 
2000 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest 
in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading 
affiliate account).

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO 
THIS REQUEST.
