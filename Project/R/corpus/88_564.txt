Hi, Georgi!
 
In light of the NYMEX being closed last week, the 5 paralegals are involved in a project right now that is taking up our extra time, so we don't know when we would be able to get to this project.  Perhaps someone in your group could come to our area and copy these files.  Just let us know who and when they will be coming and we will help them locate the documents.
 
Thanks!
 
Marie
