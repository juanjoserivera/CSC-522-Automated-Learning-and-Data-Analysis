Can one of you make sure LT-SERC is still an active book (if not, have it reactivated) and coordinate with TJae regarding the EOL ID.  John may still be set up in EnPower, I am not sure that his access was ever taken away, but we need to have his trader ID attached to LT-SERC.

Let me know if you have any questions.
