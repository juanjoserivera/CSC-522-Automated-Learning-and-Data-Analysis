I have it in my briefcase, I just forgot to get it out.  Another slow day so far.

I checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per Lisa's comments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basically does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So Lisa's friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had no idea what these two entities did, kind of interesting.
