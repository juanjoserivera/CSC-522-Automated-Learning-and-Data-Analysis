I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.   I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.  Can  you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.
 
I am contatable on 07778757656.
 
Thanks
 
Louise
