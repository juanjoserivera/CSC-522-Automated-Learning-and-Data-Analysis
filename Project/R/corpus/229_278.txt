Bob didn't make it to the meeting but did leave a voice mail suggesting that 
rather than creating a separate GTC for the brokers we refer to the GTCs 
already online for regular customers and have them agree to be responsible 
for the liquidated damages that would be calculated under those terms if the 
deal falls through.

Mark, 

Just checking in on your conversation with Bob Schults (sp?).? If there is 
any news, please let me know.? I will be back in DC tomorrow, leaving SF 
about 3 p.m. today.? I am working on an "as soon as possible" assumption, but 
it will still be a few days before I have useful drafts for you to review.? 
But hopefully we are beyond the question phase.

Thanks, 

Bob
