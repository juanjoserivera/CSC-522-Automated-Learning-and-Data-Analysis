Hello,

Thanks for sending me an email.  I appreciate the interest and found your profile to be interesting as well.  But, I feel I'm at a disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a picture.  Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to what you look like?  Drop me a line and we can hash this out.

Paul
