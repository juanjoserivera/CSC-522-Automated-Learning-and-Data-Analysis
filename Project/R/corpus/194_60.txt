I thought ENE would be down for sure today?
Everyone was talking about it here before the market opened.
I guess the Market is just happy we told the truth?  Or they thought it was more?

I feel pretty good but I had time to adjust yesterday afternoon.
Got taxes done for everyone.

Baseball game tonight at 8:00

Why are you out of the office on Tuesday?

Be Good!
