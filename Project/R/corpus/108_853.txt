Attached is the final version of the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Unfortunately, 
the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn 
around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it.

Tana,

Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest
versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the only
outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for EnronCredit.com
Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the
outcome of this last credit point that you refer to.

My fax number is 0207 330 9999.

Many thanks for your assistance.

Kind regards,

Clare
