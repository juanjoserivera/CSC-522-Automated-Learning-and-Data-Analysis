No we don't typically intervene in CTS filings.

I assume we do not want to intervene on this although if we do please note 
the filing date.  CTS I believe is the block forwards portion of the PX.  
Also this is a compliance filing to an earlier FERC decision.

From Janet Butler's weekly summary:


California Power Exchange Corporation, ER01-80-000 and ER01-81-000. Revised 
Tariff Sheets to Amendment to Participation Agreement. On October 10, in 
Docket No. ER01-80-000, the California Power Exchange Corp. (CalPX), on 
behalf of its CalPX Trading Services Division (CTS), filed Amendment No. 5 to 
streamline the Participation Agreement between CTS and its participants. CTS 
also proposed to clarify that default chargebacks will be billed as 
administrative fees and proposes a few non-substantive editorial changes.  
Order issued November 21 accepting CTS, Amendment No. 5 as modified. Order 
rejects (1) the proposed change to the Assignment provision and directs a 
compliance filing removing it; and (2) the proposal to incorporate the 
Information Guide and states to the extent that the Information Guide 
contains terms and conditions significantly, affecting services or rates, CTS 
should file to incorporate into the CTS Rate Schedule those portions of the 
Information Guide that pertain to services and rates.  On December 19, CalPX 
filed revised tariff sheets in compliance with the November 21 order.  Filing 
noticed December 19.  Protests due January 4.
