Hey Brett,
What's been happening?  I hope you didn't buy any enron!  It is looking good for the Horns.  It seems like fate is on their side.  Every week we get closer to a Rose Bowl berth.  If we get to the Rose Bowl I will have a ticket with your name on it if you can get away.  Are you going to be able to catch the game this weekend?  BTW, are you still in Hawaii?

Hope all is well.

Your Pal,

Eric
