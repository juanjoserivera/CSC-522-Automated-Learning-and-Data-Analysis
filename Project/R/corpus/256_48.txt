The game was nail-bitingly close, but Chinese 12 year old hookah's strategy of
ChoKoNu mayhem was the deciding factor.
At one point, Beth and I soaked the earth with the blood of wave after wave of paladin assault
(and rear-action monk cowards), but it was Alan's resource control that won out.
But for the most part, I would characterize the game as a draw.
Bring on the firstperson shooters until Star Wars.
