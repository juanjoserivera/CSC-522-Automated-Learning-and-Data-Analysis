i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.  
whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to 
here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the 
weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people 
realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any 
problems...bombs away.
