It should be signed and on its way.

I've heard that they are trying to schedule a meeting for Monday, so I'm 
trying to get a draft of the agreement out.  Do you think you will have a 
chance to send me the preamble stuff?  I know it doesn't seem like a big 
deal, but I will feel better if I understand who's on first, so to speak/

Thanks,

Kay
