Subject: FW: Mark Boland - CV

Vince:  Tony Vasut, another recruiter, is bringing Mark Boland in for a 
series of interviews on 3/20 and 3/21, and asked if there was any chance that 
you or someone in your group would be able to interview him.   His resume is 
attached, and I will also send you a list of his deals under separate 
cover.    Shirley has told me that you will be in and out for the next 
several weeks, so if you are unavailable would you please suggest someone 
else in your group who might be able to interview Mark?

Thanks, as always,
Molly
