i'm doing great -- the baby is so much fun but alot of work -- i feel tired 90% of the time -- enron is actually okay -- i feel good about my chances to stay on with the "new empire" -- but, i'm still taking this as an opportunity to explore some other options to see if there may be something incredible out there that i am missing out on.  what's new with you??
