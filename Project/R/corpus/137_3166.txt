That means it is recognized, not  "contemplated to be recognized", then?  Is 
there such a thing as a recognized scheduling entity, or do you just schedule 
on their behalf?

What about this?  Is this the QSE defn? [Rorschach, Reagan]  No, that would 
be Qualified Scheduling Entity that has a very lengthly ERCOT definition.  
This was greatly simplified to eliminate any confusion.  I think it is OK as 
is. 

&Scheduling Entity8 means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and 
fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission 
of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.
