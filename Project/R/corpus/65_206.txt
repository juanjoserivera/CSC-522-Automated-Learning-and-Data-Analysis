TJ:
Please make sure that the Ercot RC is not billed for our portion of the customer trip.   If I can assist with this accounting,  let me know.    I dont wish to subsidize the other Hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense.

In the future,   I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group.
I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.

I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.   We werent able to secure a commitment from customers,  but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).    I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip
did not change,  rather the allocation to each group was changed.

My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything.
But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank,  profitability and that I have been here 8 years.
I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.

JMF
