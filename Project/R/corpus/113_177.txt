I think we will get alot of "don't knows" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for. 

 I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.

Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.
