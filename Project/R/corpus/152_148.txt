Hello!

How are things going?  I'm pretty tired this morning, I went to get a relaxer last night and got there at 8p.m. and did not leave until 11:30p.m.--pretty exhausting, but Todd is out of town today and I wanted to squeeze that in before he left and I'd have to get a sitter.  

Anyway, is everthing going well with the house?  Hope so.....My daycare notified us yesterday morning when Todd dropped the kids off that they will be closing their doors permanently on June 1st.  Talk about not getting much notice.  Anyway, needless to say, that is my new crusade!  

Talk with you later!
