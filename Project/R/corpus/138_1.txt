Bryan,

Yes, I would like to talk to you.  I think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity.  I didn't realize that you would making this decision so soon.  Maybe we can talk after bidweek (early next week).  If that timing does not work let me know.  I am still not sure if or when Lavorato is going to give me a Trading Track analyst/associate.  But I still would like to talk to you before you make a decision.

Tom
