Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78).
Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

We'll continue to provide updates.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff
