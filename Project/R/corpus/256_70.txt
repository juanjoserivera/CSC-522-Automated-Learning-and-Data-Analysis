We are totally LBs. no DEs. We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,
as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.
PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, but
he has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. Curtis Martin
is a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant Shaun
Alexander is. If he has a good game next week, he may have the starting role or at
least split carries. 
The next 2 games will be tough.
