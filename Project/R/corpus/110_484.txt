Sheridan,

I am going out to lunch with Rick Buy today and will
mention the valuation seminar. 
I shall ask Rick how many employees from his
group he would send to this program.

I have no suggestions regarding the program,
except that the last year selection of topics
was very interesting. You can include e-bus
and on-line trading as the topics for 2002.


My address is:
