Thanks for this - it is very helpful.  It seeme to have taken everybody by surprise even regulatory.  Have a great weekend and I will talk to you next week.
 
ps on the midmarket change .... I'll circle the wagons as long as necessary.  No way, no how, no reallocation.  In the East, we allocate work based on project not client base.  The West will likely be the same but .. thanks for the heads up so we can react in the most thoughtful of ways.
 
pss on the secretary front, I've been exchanging messages with Karen so I can get the facts and unanimous approval - I'll try to get MH's OK next weekend.  Will call when accomplished.
