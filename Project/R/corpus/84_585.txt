Stacy and Ruth:

I propose the following agenda for the NA energy committee:

1.  convergence of commodity forms -- need to build a team to pursue this
2.  California energy issues/solutions
3.  standardized provisions for master energy contracts -- setoff, netting, 
termination, etc.
4.  bankruptcy 
5.  CFTC study of retail derivatives
6.  emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc.

Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European conference.  
Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Mark Haedicke

		 Subject: Conference Calls

Hello Mark -- given our e-mail traffic the last couple of days I wanted to
quickly summarize our thoughts on next steps:

1.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth and Stacy re: agenda for NA Energy
Committee
2.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth, Stacy, Christophe, Katia, John re:
coordination of committee activities and agenda for December conference

Depending upon your schedule, we hope to try to get these calls scheduled
either this week or early next week.

Many thanks!  -- Stacy
