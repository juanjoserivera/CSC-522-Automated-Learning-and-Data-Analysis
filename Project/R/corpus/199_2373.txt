Tracy:  Just spoke with Michelle Sternberg.  Allegheny does not want to carve out setoff benefit for ENA because it cannot take advantage of the setoff benefit.  I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.  She'll speak with Yair.
