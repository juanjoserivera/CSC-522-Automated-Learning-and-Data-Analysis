Greg, Mark and I met with the Estate this morning and Canada did come up in terms of the Transistional Services agreement.  Could you let us see Kyle's request and we'll try and help from this end.  How many people is he asking for to be seconded to the Estate.  I am concerned over IT requirements as we never developed this software in the first place - it was created by Razorfish.

In terms of 5, the person dealing with this is actually Per Dyrvik who is going to set up a conference call for us this morning.

Peter - tried to ring you. Give me a call when you are free.
