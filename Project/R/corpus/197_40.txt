Good Morning,

Due to our current situation, I have 3 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do.  They have a wide range of experience and abilities, and would be available to assist you in whatever tasks may need handling.

Please let me know if you have temporary room for any one or all 3 of these folks, I would like them to have something to do while we are waiting for trading to resume.

Thanks,

Cara
