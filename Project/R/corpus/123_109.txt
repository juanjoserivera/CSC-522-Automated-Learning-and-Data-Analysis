First of all - blow me.

Second, my wife is expecting in early November so I might be able to slip away in September.  I would vote for anything that would require one flight from Houston.  I'm sure Rich would agree.  ie.  Timmins would be tough.  I would love to join you all and get mocked for an entire weekend.
