Thanks man!  Just for old time's sake, I'll drop by Pacific Springs and 
bounce a few off the ole' shack this summer!

Congatulations Drew!  I have mixed emotions on your leaving Omaha.  On the 
downside I'm sincerely going to miss your day-to-day presence that brings 
thoughtful incites, hard work and a fun zest-for-life atmosphere to the 
office.  On the upside (jokingly) I'll have one less golfer aiming for my 
back windows this summer.  Good luck!
