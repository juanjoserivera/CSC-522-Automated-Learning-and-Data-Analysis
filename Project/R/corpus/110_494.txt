Hello Chris,

Thanks for your message.  The first two pages look like an good opening to an article on
a spark spread option.

A few comments.

1. A spark spread model has two primary uses. It can be used for pricing stand alone options
traded in the OTC markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation
model of a generation plant.
