I hope it is not Woody, Vandy sucked at offense and defense.  He is horrible and I would hope we would go after somebody else.  We need to get someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the players can start studying it to get a head start on next year.  I am afraid if Tubby doesn't turn it around next year he may be gone.

I got a digital camera for Christmas that works real well, I will get some pictures to you.
