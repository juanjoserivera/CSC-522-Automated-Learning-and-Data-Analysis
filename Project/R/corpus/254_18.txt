Hey Buddy,
	Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him Walter.  He's a pretty good lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  Chris and Sarah had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.  I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  Joanna's brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July 1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty cool!  Jo is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along. The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.  How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  "You and your faggoty white uniforms."  Just kiddin - 

						Peace
