I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.

They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.

My contact at OATI is Frank.Billington@oatiinc.com

or  kevin.burns@oatiinc.com

Thanks,

Cara
