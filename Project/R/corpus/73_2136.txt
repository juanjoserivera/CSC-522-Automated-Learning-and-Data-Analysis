In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.

Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.
