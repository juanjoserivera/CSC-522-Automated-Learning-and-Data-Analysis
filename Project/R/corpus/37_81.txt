Suzanne,
 
Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.
 
I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.
 
Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?
 
I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow.
