I'm out of the office until around 1000 cst, but I'll call.  In the 
meanwhile, please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement.

This stuff is going fast and furious, and an executed ESA contract will be 
required for ESA closing their financing on the 13th.  That's why it is first 
in line.  We will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known 
as the Fountain Valley project (aka PSCO).  Also, I'm going to try to get ABB 
focused on doing their facility agreements.

I've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the 
turbines to confirm the payment terms.  I hope to have it this am.

What is your direct line?

Kay

Subject: RE: ESA facility agreement - close to execution version

Could you call me.  This is the first I've heard of the 25% of Change
Order 3 being added to the January payment.  That is NOT reflected in
the last draft that was sent out.  I had included all of Change Order 3
into the January payment.  The only deal that I was aware of where ENA
was doing the 75/25 split was the CA Energy Agreements.
