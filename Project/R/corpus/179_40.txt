RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The bill for 10/28/2001 may be put on hold due to problems encountered with
Performance Tracking System data.  The problem is associated with the time
change from DST to EST.  An update on the status of NYISO's efforts to
address this problem will be posted mid-afternoon tomorrow.

Regards,
Randy Bowers
