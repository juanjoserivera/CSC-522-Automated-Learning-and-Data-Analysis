On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff
