I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.  Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  Don't know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?  I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.  Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?  or just my drinking goggles?
