Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.

Take care

Louise
