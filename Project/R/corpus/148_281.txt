Kam,

I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co.  I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.  No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.

Let me know how I can help.
