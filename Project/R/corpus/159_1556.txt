I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  Eric, you might want to check with Ed and see if he has any insight.
