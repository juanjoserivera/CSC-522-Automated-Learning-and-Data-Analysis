Too bad about the Saporito's.  It's tough to see a family break apart.  It was nice that ours could stay together even if it is non-traditional.  You know how much I care about your Mom's happiness and welfare.

Too bad about your week coming up but considering the two weeks I have had you get no sympathy.  I will be here late tonight.

Love Dad..

GET THE WSJ EARLY TOMORROW!
