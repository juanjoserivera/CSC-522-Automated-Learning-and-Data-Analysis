Tom,

Greg's phone number is 713 853 5220. He is very difficult to reach
(frequent trips).

You may find this information useful: Greg is a West Point graduate
and spent a few years in the  military, before obtaining an MBA from Stanford.
He is a very dynamic person and a very pragmatic thinker.

I hope you have a great holiday weekend.

Vince

Subject: RE: B2B at Enron


Vince:  Thanks for this message and update on your recent actions to
establish a closer research relationship between Enron and Wharton.  We are
anxious to work with your firm on many fronts and appreciate all that you
and Jeff Shankman are doing to facilitate closure on a number of
initiatives.

The below article is very interesting and reinforces the entrepreneurial
culture of Enron; it also points out one more reason why our faculty is so
interested in collaborating with you and other executives as the company
moves into this new space.

I would like to call Greg Whalley after the 4th of July weekend to establish
contact and begin a dialogue regarding his interest in joining our efforts
as a Corporate Partner. Will you please provide me contact information?

Please let me know if there is any additional information or material you
will need prior to your meeting with Jeff Skilling.  We are anxious to learn
how he responds to your suggestions.

Thanks again for all that you are doing.  Hope you have a great 4th of
July!!

TOM
