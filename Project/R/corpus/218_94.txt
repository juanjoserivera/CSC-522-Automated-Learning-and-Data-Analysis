Linda,
	This is not what we agreed upon when we had our conference call. You where supposed to come back to me with your plan on how to attack this audit within a week of our conference call.  Why did you not convey this change in status to Murray or myself? And who gave you the direction to put everything on hold until Murray and Kevin spoke? Murray knows nothing about this conversation that is supposed to take place with Kevin Hughes. Let me make this as clear as possible, EPMI is the one that is driving this process and you where given your direction by me to proceed forward on this audit. I expect to see a plan in my hands by the end of this week. All communication going forward are to go through me, and I will make the decision as to who needs to be in to the process.
