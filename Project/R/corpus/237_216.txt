Meeting with PG&E went OK... they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.  PROGRESS I guess.... 

Flights were good.. got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day... 

IF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on.. .that would be great.
