Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing.  It's that simple.  Anyway as for dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if that's too late we can meet earlier.  The only thing I know that is healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big thing for you.  Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open. I'll eat anything except for Thai.  

The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.  The guy I used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.  Since I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.  But I'm sure you already know this about my personality.  I'm really not trying to BS you with my emotional side.  I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar, if you believe that to be the case. All those other delivery points need processing arrangements.  Don't tell Richard Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!
