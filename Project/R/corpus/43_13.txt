What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.  

Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the rumors have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not sure how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger will get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As far as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will be interesting.

Have fun over Thanksgiving.
