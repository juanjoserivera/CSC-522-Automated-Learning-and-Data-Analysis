Only a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!   The artickale was great.  In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports.  Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked.  I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for upcoming articles.  

Sounds as if your son had a strong start at Kleb as well.  This second six weeks is proving to be a little more challenging for Amanda - or her effort may have gotten diverted!  

I am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calendar.  --Sally
