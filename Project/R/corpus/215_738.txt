Thanks for the update.  It is disappointing that AGA is not opening the process, although the final EISB Retail Gas standards will need to be vetted by an ANSI group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other.

Also, what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocols across the board?  Seems like pushing NARUC to agree that this is the right vehicle makes sense.  

Thanks,

Jim
