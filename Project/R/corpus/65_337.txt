joan,
good to hear from you - everything is still pretty wild up here, but it is going very well.    Sorry to hear about the neighbors,  but i think that you will enjoy living downtown.
there is so much to do here now.  
how are your hours now?  im sure that they are pretty scary.

seen any good bands lately?
