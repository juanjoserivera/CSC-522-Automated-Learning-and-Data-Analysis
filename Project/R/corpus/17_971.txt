FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new Enron garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.  

I have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?  

I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!  

Thanks.  --Sally
