Please note that when we will receive a unit specific instruction,   we will also receive a category one deployment.
The unit specific instruction tells us the level that they want the unit to produce.    The category one is just a summary of how much we need to move to achieve the unit specific level.   These should not be combined .

Also,  when you receive a category 2, 3 or 4 we are essentially receiving an OOM type instruction that is settled under the OOM provisions.
