Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or 
anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, 
theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the 
best.  I could use 5x7" the most.

Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may 
want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player 
attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John 
Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.

We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the 
Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure 
that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could 
get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know.

See you later.

Michelle

We're getting Dad the dustbuster or keychain (unless you guys already have)
and Gretchen the placemats/guest towels and Span/Eng dictionary

Marianne wants some clarification on what kind of picture frames (wood/metal
(type) etc and coasters (whimsical, serious artsy, material) for your list.

I'm going to prob get Trey the Lyle CD and a playstation game. Maybe a Polo
shirt
