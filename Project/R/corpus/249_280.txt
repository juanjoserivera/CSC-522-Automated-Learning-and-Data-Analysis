Tom,

Hope this helps.

1)  Only the power positions need to be queried.  Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench.

2)  Any power Exchange transactions should be included, but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench.


Thanks,
Stacey
