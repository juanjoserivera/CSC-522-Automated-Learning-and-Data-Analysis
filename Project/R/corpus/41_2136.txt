FYI--unless I'm mistaken, the assignment that Steve gave Mike was a very 
quick and dirty analysis as I recall, i.e., should by no means be the tail 
that wags the dog.

P.S.  I eye-balled Mike's numbers, below.  Looks like about $75K for three 
months.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: FW: Proposal for Legal Services RCR

Recall that we terminated all retainers with Mike at the end of April and 
have no RCR approval for Mike for work in May.  

I called Mike and yelled at him for assuming he can work on issues with 
Sandy's approval but without RCR approval.  I called Sandi and she will 
present a number of RCRs--see below.  

I don't think we need Mike's help on windfalls profits--our position is clear 
and the research is done.  
Today and tomorrow, he's participating in two meetings with the Direct Access 
Coalition at my request to support the language we (read "he") drafted.   We 
should get Leslie more integrated on this effort--but will not be able to 
completely reduce Mike's work.

I'm really not sure what to do on power plant siting.  

Also, I'm not sure what we should do about the Global Settlement stuff.  
Apparently, Steve has already requested that Mike do some work on an issue 
(how to insert a poison pill--if the Global Settlement is upset by litigation 
or an AG indictment??).  I am very concerned that we may lose control over 
the issues or the forum unless we centralize the assignments in Jeff or 
Steve.
