Sara:

I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  

Scary, hunh?
