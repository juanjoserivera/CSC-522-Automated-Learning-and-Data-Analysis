I'll gladly bring my photo album and Alina.  Chad has a playdate at a neighbors house.

Gaby told me that she cannot attend.

You mentioned that several people may come to the get together late and that we may visit longer than 12:30 pm.  My sister is arriving in town for a visit around 12PM and a cab is picking her up at the airport.  I currently have arrangements for the cab driver to take her to my house (probably around 1 PM). Let me know if you think I should change this arrangement.   

I can't think of anyone we missed for the party, except Bobby Oldfield.  She is going to start working with us on Children's Church and was a fantastic help with VBS.  I inadvertently dropped her name from the list.  

Thank you for everything you do.  I'm always overwhelmed by your kindness.

Shelley
