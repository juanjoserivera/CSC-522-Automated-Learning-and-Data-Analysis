Girl, that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned.  I have no idea, all I know is that I don't want to drive for an hour to get to work.  I really wish I could tear down and rebuild where I am.  I love the "hood" aspect of the neighborhood, I love the "colored" folks, and so on.  I need to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what I would qualify for.  All I know, is that I'm not getting any younger, and why not enjoy a new house now, what am I waiting for?  

Girl, I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well, but it has to be done!

Jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 8:30 a.m.  When I answered the phone, I recognized her voice immediately, and I got scared that something had happened.  That heifer called to tell me that Jordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia soft drink (first of all, it took me questioning her three times to find out what the heck Fruitopia meant)  and she wanted to check with me to see if that were true, because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class because it had too much sugar in it......well, I was pissed number one, that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass question.  You are the adult here, not Jordan!  She also said Jordan kind of smarted off to her.....well, take control sister.....you obviously have no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant matter such as this.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!! 

Now on the other hand, Jordan will have to be punished for lying, but my goodness, can you believe it?
