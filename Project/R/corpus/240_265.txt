Art, 

It looks like I won't be able to make it.  I have some meetings set up that I seem to be unable to re-arrange.  I really appreciate the invite though.  Maybe next time.  However, I am going to try to make it to Albuquerque before the end of the year.  I will let you know what my plans are.

Thanks again for the invitation.  Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.

Kim
