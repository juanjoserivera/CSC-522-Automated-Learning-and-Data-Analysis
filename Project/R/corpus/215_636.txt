David --
 
My thoughts.
 
I would change the section "Reliability" to "Operations".  The Current framework is Non-standardized;  Poor Seams Interface
 
Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that "Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner."  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
 
Under Generation - I would change "optional" to Optimal.
 
I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.
 
Thanks,
 
Jim
