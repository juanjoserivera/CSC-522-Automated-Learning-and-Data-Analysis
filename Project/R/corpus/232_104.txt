Dave Evanowski and Frank Francis from the NYISO are coming to Enron on October 22nd.  We have proposed the following items for them to cover while they are here.  Please let me know if there are any other issues that you would like them to cover.  I do not have a time when they will be here, however we are pushing for the afternoon.
