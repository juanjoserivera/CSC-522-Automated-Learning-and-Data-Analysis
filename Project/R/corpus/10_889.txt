in regards to the stock, tell me about it.  
flat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while. think the next push down doesnt come again until late october.  im buying z 300/250 put spread for 11.  still looking for 3.1 by end of season.  probably 2.95-3.0 for nov 31.  who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario?
aga's... think high 70's is neutral the market.  if it comes out 70-85 you can shit on vol.  that'd be good for me.
