Please check out the following.     The agreement I reached with Ercot/Frontera yesterday is as follows:
When we receive an OOMC,  we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online.
If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME,  then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.   We dont actually want to do this,  as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.

We will discuss further in the meeting.

Thanks,
JMF
