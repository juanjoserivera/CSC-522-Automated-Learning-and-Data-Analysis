"The California Public Utilities Commission has a choice. It can adopt the 
same, common sense natural gas policy for Southern California that,s been in 
place for several years in PG&E's service territory and has worked very well 
for consumers.  Or it can stick with the status quo, which the industry 
agrees is at least partially responsible for bottlenecks and high prices in 
California.  The proposed decision opts for the status quo.  That's not going 
to solve California,s natural gas problems, and it,s likely to make matters 
worse in California's electric industry."
