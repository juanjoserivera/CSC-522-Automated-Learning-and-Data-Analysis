Vince --

I see that you are on the panel on market monitoring.  Dave Perrino and Alan Comnes are following the issue for Enron in the Western power markets as RTOs are formed.  It may make sense for some people from Govt Affairs to talk with you to discuss current issues and focus of FERC and others?  If we can get together, please let me know a good time.

Also, the attached paper from EPSA on Market Monitoring is something we support through our trade association.

Thanks,

Jim
