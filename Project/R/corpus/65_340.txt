We were down balanced in excess of what we were willing to pay,  as indicated by our bidding structure.   It seems that their software is not recognizing our bids.
Our Ercot Rep, Mark Patterson is looking into this.   
We will dispute down balancing bills for the labor day weekend,  as this problem persisted every day.

Thanks,
JMF
