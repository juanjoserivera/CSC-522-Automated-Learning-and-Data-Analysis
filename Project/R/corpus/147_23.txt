Hello favorite Aunt (and I do have more than one),

How much do you want to try to sell the cabinets (dolls and TV) for?  Or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price.  My plan was to sell everything I own before moving....sound familiar?  

Anyway I hope everything is going well and have a good time on your Alaskan safari.

Email me with the info. and I'll give you a call.

Love

Jon
