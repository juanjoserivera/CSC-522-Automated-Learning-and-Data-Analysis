I understand, but this is a difficult measure to build into a budget system, other than simply limiting the amount of capital you have available to meet your IBIT target.  We can't allow a dicision to cut IBIT by 90% and capital by 95% and call it a success.  The easiest way to control deployment of capital is thru a deal approval process.
