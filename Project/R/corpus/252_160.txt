Stewart,
I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th.
But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers.
Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st? Could they come the morning of the 19th?
Let's get together and talk regardless.

Nice job on NCPA, I appreciate the hard work.
Thanks,
Bill
