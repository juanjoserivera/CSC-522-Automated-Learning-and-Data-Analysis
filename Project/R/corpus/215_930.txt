Please do not contact these customers. 

FYI, Enron signed the following customers after July 1 (we are checking on Wal-Mart).

I would like Bev and Hedy to rank these parties with their ability to help in Sacramento with our messaging.  Once you have this, let's talk this afternoon to plan going forward.

As you can see from the e-mail, we are going to have to work through our business people.
