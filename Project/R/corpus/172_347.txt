Mojo,

that is sweet , pardon the pun
those cakes look great , what is in the casino cake ?
it looks pretty cool

How are things going for you ?
Have you settled into a groove yet ?

This past weekend was great for me.
I spent the entire weekend with Kay , 
we had dinner with my parents on sat. Night
and just hung out the entire weekend.
I have had a very different out look on life lately and
it has been working well for me. I have started to ask
alot more questions instead of always assuming the answer.
It has been working well for me.

Hope all is good with you.
