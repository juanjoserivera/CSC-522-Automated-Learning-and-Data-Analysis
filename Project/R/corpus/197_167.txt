Good Morning,

I need new logins created for the following people

Serena_Bishop
serena.bishop@enron.com
pw: welcome

Mike_Purcell
mike.purcell@enron.com
pw: welcomeback

I need the following logins deleted:

Lisa Gang
Susie Wilson
Stacy Runswick


Within a couple of weeks, most of the Enron folks will no longer be active, and I will have no access to the system.  Mike Purcell will be handling the account and can be reached at mike.purcell@enron.com

Please call me at 503/464-3814 within the hour if there is additional information that you need to set up Serena and Mike's logins by the end of today.

Thanks
