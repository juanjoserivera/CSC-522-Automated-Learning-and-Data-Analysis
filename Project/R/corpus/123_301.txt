I would offer him the initial contract assuming its what I think it is.  I know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with.  I basically told everyone to drop it when Mike proposed his numbers.  Again, the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks.  We naively thought that these would be accepted quickly.  For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early, they did exactlty that.  

Let me know if you want to discuss it further.
