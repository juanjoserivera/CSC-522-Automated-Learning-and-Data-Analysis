Roman,

Sorry. I am leaving for Philadelphia this evening. Leaving office around 5
p.m. Let's get together on another occasion.

 Hi Vince,
   I am in Houston now. Will have to work late . But how about drinks/food
some time around 7-8 or later ?  I am staying at Wyndham Greenplace (?) and
will use taxi to get around.
  Thanks
Roman
