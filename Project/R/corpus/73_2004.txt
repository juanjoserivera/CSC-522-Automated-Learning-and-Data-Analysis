I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.
