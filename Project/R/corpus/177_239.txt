Bob,

we had the meeting today called your desk at 1pm PDX time with no answer.   not sure what went on there
because we also didn't get your voicemail.  

we'll have to catch up next week.

Didn't receive a call today.... you guys are probably just really busy.

Should we do it on Monday, or just wait until next Thursday?
