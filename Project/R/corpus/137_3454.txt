I don't know if David Hunt will have comments.  In any event, Marvin, Bob and 
the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it.  

Reagan has my current requests.

Subject: RE: Extension letter

Kay -- Do you know if David H. is going to give you comments?  If you haven't 
heard for sure, one of us will call Marvin and find out/coordinate.  Just 
don't want to call if this has already been discussed with them.

Is there anything else at this stage that we can do to help your efforts on 
the Extension or the main agreement?

Thanks  -- David
