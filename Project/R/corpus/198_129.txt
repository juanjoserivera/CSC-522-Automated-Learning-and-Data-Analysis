Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an 
hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 
24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll 
advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.  Thanks again for your 
help.

Subject: RE: Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock


Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris
