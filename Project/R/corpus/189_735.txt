Thanks for your help on this. I have asked Twanda to set up a meeting to talk 
about all the matters you have and the potential insurance coverage for the 
Cleveland case.

		 Subject: RE: Service of Process - Crown/MCN Arbitration

You will receive this service of process today. I have already spoken with 
Sam Gaufin, Crown Energy's counsel, re the subpoena served on us by MCNIC.  
ENA holds preferred stock in Crown Energy, but, as I understand from talking 
with Dan Lyons, we don't consider it to really have any value.  In any event, 
I will make sure that Sam knows what we are producing before it is produced, 
and I have made arrangements for a protective order with respect to any Enron 
confidential information (although thus far I have seen only a little that 
would fall into that category).  Let me know if you have any 
questions/comments.
