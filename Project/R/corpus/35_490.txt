Thanks for the message.  I'm confirming with credit that this language is

Carol - Re: the Schedule, here is the new "30-day language" for your review.
Also attached is the Enron Gty you wanted me to e-mail you.  I've made the
other three typo changes you mentioned and am running off final documents
for execution.  I will fed ex them to you this evening after obtaining
signatures on this end.  Susan and I spoke this morning and after you
receive the fed ex package and turn them over to her, she and I will proceed
from there. We both have copies of our checklist.

Thanks - Maria
