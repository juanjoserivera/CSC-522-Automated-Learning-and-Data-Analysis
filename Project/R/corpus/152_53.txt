Yes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with you?  How are the proceedings coming along?

Everything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation, whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.

I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?

By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.

Write back!!!!
