I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phone.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continental is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each other!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics definitely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the Enron people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I figure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll just get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's going to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip after you have a chance to look...Lisa and I have both been to Salzburg, but I don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.

Ciao,
Sue
