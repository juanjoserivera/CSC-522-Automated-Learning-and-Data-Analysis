I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.
