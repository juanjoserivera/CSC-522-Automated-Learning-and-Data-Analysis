Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future.   Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22.  We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.

Let me know.

Thanks

Tracy
