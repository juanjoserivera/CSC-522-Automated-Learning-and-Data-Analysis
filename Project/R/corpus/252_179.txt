Sorry to hear about Racheal...so the Bretts weren't gay? But what about Nancy...
I haven't been to the Breakroom. I think I will be coming up to Seattle on either Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. I haven't decided yet. I am taking Friday off from work though...my birthday is on Thursday...isn't your birthday here in the tail end of August--or am I thinking of Chuck. Erica Price? from the dorms, rowed crew, tall, red hair, sometimes slightly neurotic?..that would be kind of fun to run into her, anyway...I'll get back to you when I figure out what the heck is going on.
Later.
Bill
