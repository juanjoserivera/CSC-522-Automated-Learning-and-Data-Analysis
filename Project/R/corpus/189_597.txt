Yes I have.  He's a very nice guy who is anxious to see his daughter.  I've
tried to contact Michael Coury but he has not called me back yet.  I have
tried him again today.  Hopefully he has seen the light since you talked
with him last.  Felix told me his story and from his perspective, there
doesn't seem to be anything that would allow the grandparents to maintain
custody of Alexis.  I'm going to work through HVLP to hopefully resolve this
matter in the Texas court.  I will be happy to keep you updated with my
progress.
