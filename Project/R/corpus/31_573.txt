I have looked at the policy and have no major issue with it, except to the extent that it may be either duplicative or different from policies that Corp. is looking to implement.

I agree with Paul's approach on the practice aspect as well as the statement that management will take reasonable steps to look for their unaccounted-for personnel.

Paul, it might make sense for you to talk with Robert Jones and David Oxley, who are looking at overall security issues in the wake of the terrorist attacks.
