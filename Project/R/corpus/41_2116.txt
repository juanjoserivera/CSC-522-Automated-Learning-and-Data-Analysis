Team,
Let's shoot for Tuesday, May 15, at 2:00 p.m. CDT, 12: 00 noon, PDT.  Mark, 
we'll call you.  Jeff, I don't know if you're available, but if you've got a 
spare minute, it'd probably be a good idea for us to rally by phone before 
the Hearing.  Glen, I'll call you also.

Kim, Steve, if you guys want to sit-in, we'll make the call from one of the 
offices.
