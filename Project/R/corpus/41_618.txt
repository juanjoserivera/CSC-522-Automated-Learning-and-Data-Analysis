Damnit Jeff.  What is the sleeping situation in the second cabin.  I don't
have time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The panic is my waste of time trying to get things organized.  That's the
panic.  I also don't want to tell people there are beds for them if there
are not.  Could you just right a simple straightforward email with the
number of beds.  Was there a math error on that one also????
