I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are little bungalows.

2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @ www.aubergedusoleil.com.

You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -
