Hi Limor

The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of the DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written agreement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, starting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters together and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairly extensive due diligence review.  

Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.
