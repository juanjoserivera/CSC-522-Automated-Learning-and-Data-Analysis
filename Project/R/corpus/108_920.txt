It's just you and me tomorrow.  Soma is having furniture delivered from Star 
and they said they could only come between 8-12.  So shall we drive 
together?  Do you want to come to my house?  At what time?

Of course.  Do you two want to be there for the early show or I could just
meet you there later?

Also, you can sign up on the internet for the early bird show.  I don't
think you can pay when you get there, except if you go at 10 a.m.
