useful.  Hang in there.

Jeff, thanks so much!  Don't know how I missed this email last night.
Really appreciate it, and look forward to receiving the remaining material.
The Governor referenced the nordpool last night in a session, so this will
make our research alot easier, at least on that one!!!
