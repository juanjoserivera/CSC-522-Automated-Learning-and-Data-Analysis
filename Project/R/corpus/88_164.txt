WHAT????????  How can this be?  Who allowed this to happen?  What are we going to do?  There is no one worthy to take your place as favorite credit person.  Those structuring people can't possibly be nicer than us.  I guess I wish you well, although it's going to be bad for us.  Oh, as far as the HUGE Happy Hour, I hope you aren't getting your hopes up too high.  Remember, it's Bill!

Seriously, we will miss you and I wish you all the best.
