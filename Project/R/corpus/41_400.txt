Harry, Jeff, & Sue --

I keep getting these notes from Jeanne on different matters.

1. Is there any way to get Jeanne to start using non-CPUC terms to define the 
dockets (e.g., SCE PE Advice process)?  I have a very difficult time trying 
to figure out what material is being discussed.

2. I would like to have meeting to establish our priorities and leadership 
roles for the CPUC going forward.  Not sure how our decisionmaking is taking 
place.  I know that Harry has been taking a lot of the lead on these matters, 
but want to make sure that from a personnel focus we are doing our best.

I'll ask Linda Noske to set up a call for this Thursday am.

Thanks,

Jim
