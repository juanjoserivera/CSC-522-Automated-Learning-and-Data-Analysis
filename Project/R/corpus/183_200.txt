No,

There's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely,
I don't know what's going to happen over the next few months.  As a 
result, we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial
situation is better known.  

Glad to hear everything's going well.  Did you go out to California?
What are your plans over Thanksgiving?
