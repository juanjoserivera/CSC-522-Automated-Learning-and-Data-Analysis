Will do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.  

Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.  

What would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --Sally
