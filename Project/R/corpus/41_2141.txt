Rick/Paul:

Message(s) received loud and clear.  I'll await Paul's email and proceed 
according to that plan.

Best,

		 Subject: RE: FW: Proposal for Legal Services RCR

I already lost it with both Sandy and Mike yesterday.  

Sandy will be preparing three or four RCRs for discussion at the next RCR 
meeting.  In the meantime, on an emergency basis, I've authorized Mike to 
participate in two Direct Access meetings and one conference call with the 
author of the environmental dispatch legislation.   Sandy assured me that the 
environmental dispatch legislation would (if passed) gut the gains we made in 
the siting legislation recently passed.  

On a going forward basis, one of the RCRs will be re:  the global 
settlement.  I think it is critical that Mike report to Jeff on all matters 
relating to the global settlement whether they are legislative or not.  I'm 
drafting an e-mail that I will distribute this afternoon after you have had a 
chance to look at it that should clarify matters.
