Religion, huh?  Interesting.  Your folks may disown you, though.  I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?

The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.  Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.

The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?  Next week or week after?  (May want to wait until plane service gets normal?)

Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?  Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!  Sell the flat, dammit.

Kisses,
Jeff

PS Colleen doing OK?  I can come by after class on Wednesday--class is at Boalt, so we get out at 8:30, you know what slackers law students are....
