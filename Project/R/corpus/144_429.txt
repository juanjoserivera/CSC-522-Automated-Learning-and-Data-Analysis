At Enron Net Works, it has become clear that we have a tremendous opportunity 
to utilize our unique strengths, skills and new business efforts across an 
entire new set of opportunities being created in the private equity markets.  
Because of this, we have reorganized the Enron Net Works Investments Group 
with the view to leveraging the group better across strategic opportunities 
in the eCommerce and technology space, and within Enron.

Effective immediately, Jay Fitzgerald will take responsibility for setting 
ENW,s investment strategy and the implementation of that strategy.  Reporting 
to him in this new role will be Steve Horn and the venture investing group.  
Further, Alan Sommer will be joining Jay,s team to focus on developing new 
market opportunities, with a focus on working with the various domestic and 
international Enron business units to develop eCommerce-related businesses 
and strategies.

Jay will be working both out of the New York and Houston offices in his new 
role, and can be reached at jay@enron.com or by phone at either (212) 
702-3934 or (713) 853-9914.
