yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  

i don't really shop for "yoga clothes" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.  

dude, that 6:00am yoga story is brutal!  YIM is going downhill - i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors.  i hope core yoga stays solvent!
