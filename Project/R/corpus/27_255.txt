We can help you interview. Bradford and Port can really help in this process but its best if you screen them first. As far as dates go we have an Enron BOD mtg coming up which totally consumes us. This meeting is in early May, so after mid April it starts to get crazy. It would be easier for me if you gave me a couple dates and I will see if we can accommodate. Rick
