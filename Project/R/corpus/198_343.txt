Dear Neil,

If you can come to ours, it would be greatly appreciated.  We're located at 
1400 Smith Street, Suite 5007.  You can park in the Allen Center Garage 
visitor parking (entrances off of Clay and Andrews Streets), which is 
connected to our building by a skywalk on the 3rd floor.  You'll have to 
check in with security in the lobby of our building, but I'll let them know 
you and Paul are expected so as to expedite the process.  Will anyone else be 
accompanying you?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
Assistant to Jeff Skilling
