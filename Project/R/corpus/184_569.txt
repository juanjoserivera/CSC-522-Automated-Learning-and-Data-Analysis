Elizabeth,

I have utilized the structuring spreadsheets Tanya used in the original calculations to determine the PG&E receivables.  To the best of my knowledge the following are the settlement numbers for PG&E:

Enron Canada Corp.

		US$387,627.50
April 6-11	C$2,635,052.00
		US$465,153.00
March receivables unchanged.

Enron North America Corp.
No physical flow in April.  All receivables from March.  No change.

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
April 1-5	US$374,720.00
April 6-10	US$374,720.00
March receivables unchanged.

Please call if you have any questions.
Bill
