You know you got me all fired up now, I am going to put on the full court press to keep the tradition alive.  I am attaching a map from El Cajon to Houston for driving directions.  They say it will take 24+hours, I calculated the time and I think the jilly mobile can do it in 20.  Ashley is probably going to drive the Burban over to NO and I am going to fly because of work.  So you guys only have to drive to Houston and she will do the rest.  Sounds like a good idea to me(yeah right).  I will even throw in a Love trip back to SD this summer/fall if I can get a visit in April.  Two for one baby, you can't get a deal better than that except at Costco.  Plus, I almost forgot the best part - we have a little TV for the burban so you could get a little MLB 2001 action on the way.....(give me enough time and I will keep it coming)


PL
P.S. - we also have the Milton's bread here(so you can make sandwiches for the trip to NO)
