Absolutely, we would enjoy having Angela Dorsey join us for dinner.  I am glad that you made the suggestion.  Please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar, and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well.  

Thanks for the congratulations.  Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.  

I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.  --Sally
