Thank you for your kind words.
 
This is the hardest decision and the most painful one I have ever had to make.  Dave needs his family so much right now, as he has very few friends. Please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that.
 
I am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends. 
 
I promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm.
 
Love,
 
C
