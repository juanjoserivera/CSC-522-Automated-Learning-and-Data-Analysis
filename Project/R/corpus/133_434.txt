Can you tell me if this is the last financial list we are going to get?  Jeff Gossett wants to be able to tell Don Miller if we are completely done or not.  Can I also get a master list of all financial CP's we should have moved to the bankruptcy book.  We want to run some reports to make sure IT has gotten them all out of the Price book.  Thanks.
