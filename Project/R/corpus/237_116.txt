I was going to add a footnote to this note but thought I didn't need to as I know for a fact ( by individual ) that we do not have any issues in West Gas Orig.  This note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that Mike holds his trading organization to and I support this completely.

Your work hours are not in question... nor are those of Denver, and Houston based origination. However I will reiterate that we need to get back to basics and stay focused and I will promote that message given every opportunity.
