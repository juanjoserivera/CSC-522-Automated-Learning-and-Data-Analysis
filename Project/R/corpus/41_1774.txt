That's the ticket on the recipe.  I can give you some more ideas if you 
like.  Please let Prentice and me know what we can do to pitch in.

Best,
Jeff

I plan to be booting everyone out of my house before/upon my return from the
airport, if you catch my drift, but perhaps we can place some people in Amy
Hood's upstairs abode to slave away?  Or you can just come at 5:30 or 6?
I've told people to come at 7:30, I think, but I am pretty flexible on that.

Amy Hood will provide salad plates, and I think my regular dinner plates are
big enough to fit pasta and steak/potatoes/radish salad (which is really a
garnish anyway).  Does that work?
