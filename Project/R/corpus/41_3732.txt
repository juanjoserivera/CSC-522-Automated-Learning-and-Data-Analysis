Since the bills that passed are all Burton/Senate bills, it may be the case that a deal has been cut at the leadership level involving 78 and the other energy-related bills (SB 18 in particular). Scott, Hedy, Bev---Can you do a bit of checking to see if this is the case?  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
