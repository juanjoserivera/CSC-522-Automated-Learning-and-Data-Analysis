Ms. St Clair:

Questions reference the comments to the ISDA draft should be directed to
Edward Hammond at 414-297-5619.  Ed is the attorney reviewing the ISDA
draft.

Please email your Guaranty amendment to me again and I will forward to our
attorney for review.  As I will be on vacation from Friday, July 14 through
Wednesday, July 19, I would like to resolve at least the Guaranty amendment
prior to my departure.
