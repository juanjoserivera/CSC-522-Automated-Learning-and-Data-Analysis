Jimbo, thank you for the message.  I, too, have great, ever-lasting memories of our times together in Spain and Scottsdale. I am confident that there will be many more to come.  Please let me know how much longer you will be in Spain so that I can attempt to visit you again.  You have wonderful skills and integrity and a very big and caring heart, and you will do extremely well in whatever career life offers you. I am proud to be your father.  Love, Dad
