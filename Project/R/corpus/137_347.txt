I tried to figure out how to print the whole thing, but failed.  Did she 
figure out how to print the entire document?  It really has a lot of 
information on it.

Subject: RE: LM6000 Contract Payment Allocations

Thanks for the update.  Sorry for the confusion over the turbine numbers
and delivery dates.  The spreadsheet my secretary printed out only had
the amounts due, but I see that when I open it on the screen, I can see
the turbines, due dates, etc.
