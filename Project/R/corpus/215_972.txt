Charles --

Very well put.  This is another example why it is so important for you and Andy R. to be out with the RTO teams helping us to be more precise.  We need to blend our NERC and FERC advocacy.

Of course, you realize that ELCON will never support a PJM model central marketplace for balancing energy.  At the last EPSA meeting, ELCON really blasted centralized pools.
