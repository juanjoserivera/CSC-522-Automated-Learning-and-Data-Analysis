Sure,  I am online everyday.
I get in about 6 am, usually putting the numbers on at 6:30.   I start with hr ending 8-22 and change to 9-22 usually when the first interval of he 9 is printed. 
This is at my discretion.   
You may post a limit order (either a bid or offer) that covers mine and transact online.   You wont necessarily be trading with me,  another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid.

Let's trade it up!!!
