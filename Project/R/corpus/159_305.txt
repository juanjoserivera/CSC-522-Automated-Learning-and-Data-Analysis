Would it be possible to do this call tomorrow afternoon?  About 1:30 or 2:00 
central time.  My morning is a little tight.

Gerald,

Keith McClelland (AMUS lawyer), Daniela Horth (Contract Administrator for
AEC Storage and Hub Services Inc. and Wild Goose Storage Inc.)  and I are
available tomorrow morning between 10 and 12 for a conference call.  I am
still trying to confirm that Ryan McGeachie (Credit Analyst) is available.
Does this time look okay for you?  Let me know and I can confirm everything
later today.

If you do have any written comments that would be useful for us to see
beforehand, please send them on to me by email or by fax (403-290-8479).

Thanks so much.

Ann
