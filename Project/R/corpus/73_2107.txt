I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).
