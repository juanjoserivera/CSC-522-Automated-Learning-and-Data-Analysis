I think the easies way to get me the approval is for your contact to go talk to the contact at Merita we negotiated the ISDA with and have them send me an email or fax telling me it is OK to release the ISDA to you.  The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258.
