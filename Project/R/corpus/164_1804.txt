I am not currently negotiating any deals with this counterparty.  If the contract is with HPL, any issues they have should be directed to AEP.  Also given your information regarding trade status,  I  would not consider entering into any type of contract with this company.  Finally, I can offer you no info with regards to the "LLC",  The only company I am aware of is "Upstream Energy Services Company.
