Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.  Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.  
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to you soon,
Mo.
