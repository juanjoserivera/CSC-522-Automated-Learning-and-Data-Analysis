Trade qy8453 and qy9133 were both approved under the same credit terms.  The 
$4MM LC that has been specified as an independant amount and the associated 
$6MM credit line should be made a part of both confirmations and tied to both 
deals.  Approval of these deals was based on the combined risk profile of the 
trades, so securitization of both trades should be amalgamated.

thanks
brant
