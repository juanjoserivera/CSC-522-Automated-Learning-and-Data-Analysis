Nancy, I can go either way.  If you guys want to meet and then I can catch up with
Donna that is fine.  I just wanted to be sure we got you the answers you needed.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
I met with Donna this morning to talk about the budget.  I'm preparing a worksheet so that we can get all the changes straight.
If you'd like to meet with us I can let you know when I'll be there.  We don't have a firm time because I don't know how long this report will take.  
Nancy
