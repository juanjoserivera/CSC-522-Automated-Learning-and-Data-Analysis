Subject: Liquids Violation Memo: Nov. 6

Liquids desk has a VaR violation for effective date Nov. 6 of  $8.2MM, over 
its limit by 3 percent. 

The violation was due to heating and gasoil going shorter by 939K barrels.  
Essential, shorten the heat/gasoil position reduced the overall net long 
products, portfolio causing the crack spreads to widen when crude oil is net 
short 5MM barrels.

Furthermore, volatility on crude was up 3 percent with 15 cents upward move 
in price.
