Yair:

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining issues, 
including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is 
adequate.  

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for 
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too 
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.
