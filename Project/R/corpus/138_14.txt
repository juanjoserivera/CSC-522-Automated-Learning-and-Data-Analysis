Maybe we should meet.  I am not sure what Dave has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change.  My objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job.  The bottom line is that Dave is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move Dave into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under the impression that Dave cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this?
