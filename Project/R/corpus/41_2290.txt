I'll forward the piece to Brulte via email and offer to meet with him when 
I'm in Sacramento on Monday, or have a phone call with him before Monday to 
discuss the proposal further if he would like.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, am forwarding this to you for your info and possible further handling.  
Ken is on vacation, but I will send this to him.

Thanks.
