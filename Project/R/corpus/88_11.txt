Martha:

Thanks for getting the changes to the form of guaranty approved.  Will you please have the guaranty dated effective as of January 1, 2001?  Also, who will be the party signing the guaranty, and when can we expect to receive the signed guaranty?  In addition, when  the guaranty has been signed on your part, will you please fax a copy to me at (713) 646-3490?

Again, thank you for your assistance on this.

Marie
