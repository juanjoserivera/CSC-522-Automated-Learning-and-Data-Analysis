Michelle:

Per my voice mail, please:

(1) review the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 1, 2000 (Section 4.4(d)) between Allegheny Energy Supply Company LLC and Enron Power Marketing, Inc., as amended, for your previously negotiated setoff language, and

(2) please forward a copy of the proposed setoff language to Anthony Wilson so that he can explain what portion of the provision violates Section 6 of PUHCA.  I will be available for a call at his (and your) convenience.

Thanks.  Sara
