I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the 
cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the 
reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting 
yours, so I would be glad to do so.  

I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't 
necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for 
me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary 
party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and 
Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good 
year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward 
to good use.  --Sally

Ok--being the one that probably doesn't really have the dollars to do this I
would still say "yes"----will try to make room on a credit card for
this--have until June so I think it is ok.....

Will call the picture lady tomorrow and see what the price would be for
that--will email you the results.
