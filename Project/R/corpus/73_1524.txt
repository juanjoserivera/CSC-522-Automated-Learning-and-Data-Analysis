Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.
