Brenda:  Thanks.  Also, do you have a Raptor IV minibook?  We don't have any  
Raptor IV documentation.  Do both swap parties intend to transfer positions?

Just to clarify... the transfer of the swap has not been put on hold, but the 
sale of the assets hedged by the swaps.  I have been working on the asset 
sale out of Rawhide, but I'm not familiar with the transfer of the swap.

Sara,

I will send executed copies of the swaps shortly.

Thanks,
B
