Lynn,
Bob Burleson suggested that I contact you regarding employment. I am currently in the process of posting out and am very interested in your department's positions which Bob briefly spoke to me about. Currently, I am working in the Tax Accounting area but have wanted to get back into the Operational and Financial side being that is where most of my experience lies. 
I am attaching my resume for consideration. 
Thank you very much for your time,
Anna
