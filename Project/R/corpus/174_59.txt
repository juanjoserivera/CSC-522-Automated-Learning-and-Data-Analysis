Lorraine,

	Thanks for forwarding the attached message. The way I read this, PSNM is effectively withdrawing its demand for the collateral as long as we don't use the contract. We should probably send them a letter confirming that this is the case. I would suggest that you just send an e-mail in response stating that what PSNM has proposed is acceptable and that our understanding is that PSNM will not require collateral as long as we don't utilize the contract. Therefore, PSNM's demand for collateral by December 15 is, based on our understanding, withdrawn. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
