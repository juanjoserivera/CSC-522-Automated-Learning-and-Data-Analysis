Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the "effective online date" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the "early termination payment" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract "fixed price" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in "early termination payment" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).
