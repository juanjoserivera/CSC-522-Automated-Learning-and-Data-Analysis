My thoughts --

1.	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.
2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.
3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.
4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.
5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?  Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.

Thanks,

Jim
