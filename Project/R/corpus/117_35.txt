Kristin,

Here is some information requested from E&Y for gas.

Number of books				182
Number of people				55
Average number of transactions per day	1,674
Number of active transactions		126,878


Other than the rolls supporting the DPR which Scott Palmer is working on, this should be it for us.

Please let me know otherwise.

Thanks
