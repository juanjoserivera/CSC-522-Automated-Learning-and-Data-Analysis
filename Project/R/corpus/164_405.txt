In response to your e-mail please see the attached draft sent to Trans 
Canada.  Be advised Trans Canada was less than eager to negotiate this 
agreement and as of today there has been no action.   It would be great to 
get both  executed!!

Christy, I am going to speak with Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal to obtain 
the most recent version of the Master between ENA and Transcanada Energy 
Marketing USA, Inc. and will forward it when I receive it.  I also will check 
into the status of that unexecuted Master as it may be that we can assist in 
getting both executed at the same time.  Thanks.
