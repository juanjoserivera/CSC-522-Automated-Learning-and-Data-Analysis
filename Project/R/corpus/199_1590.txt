Thanks.  We amended the guaranty yesterday to do just that.  We are trying to 
have the guaranty executed.

Stephanie:  We will ultimately need to attach the "Clement approved" form of 
guaranty to the Confirmation.  Also, we may as well note the new guaranty in 
the amendment to the first transaction.

Looks good to me.  We will need to amend our outgoing gty by increasing the 
amount from $10MM to $20MM and also expand gty coverage to cover all agmts 
which are financially settled w/ ENA.
