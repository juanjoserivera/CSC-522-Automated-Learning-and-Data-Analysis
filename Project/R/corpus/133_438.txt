I wish you would come back - it would give our stock price a shot in the arm...press release...DK is back at work!!  I will talk with DG and get with you on a date, we are pretty busy around the holidays, maybe we can hit something up during the week.  Does Gary get home at a decent time during the week?  I now am over the east desk, so my hours recently increased.  We will see.
