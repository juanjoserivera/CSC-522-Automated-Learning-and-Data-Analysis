I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).  Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g. a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go.
