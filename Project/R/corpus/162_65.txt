 SONY TAKES ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR DVD 



 

Sony is taking entertainment to the next frontier! The DVP-FX1  portable DVD 
player will be the first of its kind in space, playing  movies and music for 
three astronauts aboard the International Space  Station. 

Five Sony portable DVD players will be on board, along with about  50 DVDs 
and CDs, forming the first audio/video entertainment system  in space. The 
ultrathin units are encased in a magnesium alloy housing  that's not 
available on any other portable DVD player. The casing was  integral in the 
player's selection to go into space, as it provides  the lightweight 
durability needed for space travel. 

The DVP-FX1 will be challenged by some unearthly conditions. The  shuttle 
taking the astronauts to the Space Station will lift off at  a speed of 200 
mph when it clears the tower, before reaching an orbital  speed of 17,500 mph 
and encountering a maximum of three-G forces. After  having endured such 
extremes, the player will rely on its Advanced  SmoothScanT Picture Search 
for seamless transitions between video  frames. The limited space aboard the 
shuttle and the International  Space Station is no problem for the DVP-FX1, 
which is slimmer than  three stacked DVD cases, even with the battery. 

What will the astronauts watch in space? Go to http://www.sonydvdinspace.com/ 
to  cast your vote for the contents of the first DVD library in space!
