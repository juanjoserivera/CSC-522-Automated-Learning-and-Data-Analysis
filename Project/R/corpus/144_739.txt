Effective December 15, 2000 Enron Global Markets US employees will begin 
using XMS (Expense Management System) to process employee expense 
reimbursements.  

XMS is a web based employee expense reimbursement system which will provide 
the following benefits;

> More timely reimbursements to employees
> User friendly Web access
> Ability for employee or designated administrative assistant to submit 
expense reimbursement
> Greater efficiency and lower cost

This system will replace our current manual expense reimbursement process.  
All employee expense reimbursements for EGM domestic employees submitted 
after December 15, 2000 should be done via XMS.  Non US based EGM employees 
should continue to utilize the same expense reimbursement process that 
currently exists.
