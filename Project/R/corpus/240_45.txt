John,

Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.  I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of Stephanie Miller who is the tport expert in our group.  Then you can decide how you would like to persue.  Stephanie will be available in the morning before 11:00 am CDT.

Please give me a call when you can -

Thanks,

Kim
