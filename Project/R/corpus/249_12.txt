Whenever we asked to give terminated information for the Estate we should include the 'Alberta ENA Bankruptcy' portfolio.  The transactions in this portfolio are transactions entered into by Canada using a ENA contract that has now been terminated.

If you have specific questions, please contact Kathy Reeves.
