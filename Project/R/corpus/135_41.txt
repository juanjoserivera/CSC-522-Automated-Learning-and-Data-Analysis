Hey you.  I just came back to my office, the one I'm moving into once all the construction is over.  Only the contractor pulled out and all construction has come to a stop!  The contractor, Todd, isn't acting all that honestly in this bankruptcy stage.  Where and what time do you want to meet tomorrow?
