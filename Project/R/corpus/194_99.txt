I slept good also!
Today is supposed to be close to 90, but then the front moves through and Thursday is supposed to be 74
I would like to do the half marathon with you but unless I have allot more free time I don not think I can get into a shape that I could run that far! 
I'm really fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm getting pressure or inferences that if I do not drop things my bonus might not be there!
Saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter!
They really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance!
It does get me down because I'm not sure mankind is worth it!
If people you thought had standards, ethics and morals are now applying pressure, whets the use?

Sorry, to be complaining!
Talk to you later!
