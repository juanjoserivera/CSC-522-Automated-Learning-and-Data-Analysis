Yea, me giving up what is with that. So I got to go out like a punk and you went down in a blaze of glory, beautiful. How is everything going in the wonderful PacifiCorp world? Did you ever settle into a specific job or do still move around. Risk group seems to be doing better, they even get to get off early one day a week. I am pretty much spending all of my time in Houston working on the EES project, kinda sucks s far as the travel goes. I don't know if you heard, but we lost Sean could lose more at year end when all of the contracts come to duration.
