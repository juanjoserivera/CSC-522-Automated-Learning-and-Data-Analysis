I don't really like the organization of it much.  I think things need to be 
moved around and re-organized.

Kay,

I have gone through the first 37 pgs and landed on the Energy Mgmt Svcs Agmt 
when it occured to me that I really could use an education on the contract 
structure.  So I am backing up to outline the doc(s) to see how everything 
fits.  Call me when you get a few minutes...I need a lesson.

Thanks,

Reagan
