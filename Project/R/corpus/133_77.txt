I only show that we should have triggered 1127631 for December and they did not trigger 1131418 at all.  They will need to provide documentation to us - i.e. signed confirms that show this was done.  Is the trigger price they are suggesting in our favor or not?  If it is in our favor, I am sure we will change it ASAP.  Please let me know.
