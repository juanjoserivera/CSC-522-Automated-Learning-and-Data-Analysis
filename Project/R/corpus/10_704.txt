of course.  info here goes nowhere. we've had trouble discerning where the switching takes place because the economics get very blurry: credits, ldc costs, transport, taxes, restrictions on # hours plants can burn resis are hard to account for and are different for everybody.   also some noneconomic factors... convenience, inertia, multi-month fuel purchases, hedges, accounting procedures, resid in storage already...  It's a big blur in my mind.  I look at general levels and for anecdotal evidence.  have seen zero anecdotal evidence so far.  will also watch aga's for the indication,  but so will everybody else.
