Steve,

Attached, for your information and reference, is copy of a presentation that 
was created as an internal briefing document on the business activities 
within EGM.  The purpose of this presentation is to communicate our 
activities and provide individuals with a more detailed reference document on 
these businesses in case they come up in Q&A.

This is a confidential and internal document, which includes earnings 
targets, goals and objectives.  We have a shorter more external version that 
we use to describe our businesses.  I can provide that copy if you are 
interested.

Please don,t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like 
to discuss this in more detail.  

Thanks,
mike

PS I sent this to IR and Palmer but yours came back due to a bad email 
address at EES.
