This is an email sent to me after my conversation with Rob last week.  I don't know where he is leading with this.  However will
every one please read the below and Jerry in my absense please work with everyone to try and come up with a solution that 
TW is willing to live with as we go forward as TW and EMAR (operators for Citizens).  
Sorry I won't be able to any help this week as I will be traveling to New Mexico for my Mom's funeral.  I will try and stay in the
loop as best I can.  Thanks for everyone's help in resolving this issue.

DS
