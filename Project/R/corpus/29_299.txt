Ed I have been busy in Az and have neglected your email.  Sorry about that.  Is there a one page form that I can submit that will say that nothing has changed at a faility in the last 5 years for the below facilities?  Either that or I can write a one page letter stating this fact and reqeust that the OCD renew the permit again.  Which is best for you?
