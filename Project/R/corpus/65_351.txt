Rebecca,
For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours.
I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :

he7 - 310 mw's
he8 - 310 
he 9- 240
he10 - 140
he 11 - 60

Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day..
This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.

Thanks,
JMF
