Lou,

Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.

Thanks,

Kim
