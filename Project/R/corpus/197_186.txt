Hi Sweetie,

Hopefully the visit to the Dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand? (That would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. You need to fix that ( or those as it were). Please let me know what the dr. says.

The movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. I need to vacuum but that is all.

I love you, and am so glad that I make you happy. I want us to be happy together for many years to come. I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.

See you tonight,

C
