Jim,

Thanks for your message.

We definitely plan to visit with you, as planned, next Wednesday.
We shall be flying from San Jose in the morning and we can shoot for
9:30 a.m. arrival at your office, as long as it works for you.

I shall forward your message to our lawyer and ask her to
come up with a new version of an NDA.

Look forward to meeting you next week.

Vince
