Tim,

We appreciate you sending us Green Mountain's Confidentiality Agreement, 
however we have a standard agreement that we would prefer to use.  Please 
have your legal department review the attached document and let me know if 
this will be sufficient.  If yes, we will get the application process 
underway.  Thank you so much for your time and patience.  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Confidentiality Agreement 
please contact Tana Jones at 713-853-3399.  However, feel free to contact me

Thanks again,
Adriane
