Sorry for the overreaction on Fri. I was having a very bad hair day. It seems like no harm, no foul. I need you to keep your finger on the pulse on this issue. I called Zach Starbird( Mirant) about the issue and he was surprised that Mirant had voted in favor. Can you call Brian Holman and see where they stand. If you know any of the other attys well enough, please call them and lobby them also.I am in South America this week, but would like to be on the conf. call thurs. Can you make sure I have the #s.


With respect to the PX settlement, I am an unenthusiastic supporter. Please let me know if the proposal changes.
