Drew/Mark,

Further to conversation this morning with Drew, it appears that it would be 
helpful to include the Request for Service (TFX) form in the GTC, as this is 
the form which FERC has approved for use when a customer requests pipeline 
capacity.

This would mean inserted something like the following into the Long 
Description: "Customer agrees that this transaction will be governed by the 
terms contained within the online General Terms and Conditions (GTC)."

Which would make the final long description:


US Gas NNG Capacity     Perm1 to Perm 1       Nov00-Dec00    USD/MMBtu

A transaction with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) under which NNG will 
transport, on a firm basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu per day) 
equal to the volume identified on the web site. Customer agrees that this 
transaction will be governed by the terms contained within the online General 
Terms and Conditions (GTC).The Term of the Transaction shall be from the 
Effective Date of 01 Nov 2000 to the Termination Date of 31 Dec 2000. This 
transaction provides firm pipeline transportation capacity with the primary 
receipt and delivery point of the Permian Pool (POI 54009).  The posted rate, 
stated in USD/MMBtu on the web site, is the daily reservation rate, which is 
also applicable for all alternate receipt and delivery points in MIDS 1-7, 
with the exception of Argus Zone points and Field Area TBS,s.  In addition, 
the following charges apply: the maximum commodity charge; all applicable 
surcharges; and fuel use and unaccounted for. 


The text contained within the GTC could then appear as follows:



Please let me know if you think this works and are happy with it.

Thanks,

Dave
