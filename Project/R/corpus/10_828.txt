me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness.  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong.  however, if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be, the turnaround will be very quick.
