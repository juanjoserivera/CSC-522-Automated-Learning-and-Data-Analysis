Yair:

I've left a message with Tracy Ngo (in Portland) and will let you know as 
soon as I hear from her.  How long will you be in the office today?

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same 
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty 
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion 
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit 
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at least 
BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?
