None as of yet...so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what?...I figured from your last email you were a lock.  As for myself, I'm still  waiting to hear back from Corey about the concert, so I don't know what I'm doing yet either.  I would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but I don't think the times exactly work out.  Anything in the hopper for this evening?
