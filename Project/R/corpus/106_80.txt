Christian,
 I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great 
holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to 
changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please 
make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 
10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to 
me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.

Mr. Hyvl,

Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?
