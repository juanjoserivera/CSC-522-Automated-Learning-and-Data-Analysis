I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept asking are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.  It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous.
