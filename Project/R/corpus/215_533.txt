Glenn Thomas was the chief guy in the Gov office during PECO but was relatively quiet.  He is now the Chair of the PaPUC.  He will probably just discuss how wonderful a job PA is doing.  I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif.  If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.
