Hey Ethan,

I appreciate the look on this and am interested.  i'm investigating all alternatives and have been considering mainly calgary and portland as options.  it looks like there will be more clarity on the future of enron's trading operation soon, which should help solidify any job decisions.  my latest resume is at home and i will forward it on tomorrow and you can see what the fit is like.    

thanks for thinking of me and good luck with the business.  

Cooper
