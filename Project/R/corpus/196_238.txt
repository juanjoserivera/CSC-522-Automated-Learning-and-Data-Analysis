The Star Diva has spoken!  I believe she is correct in everything but the 
last part...if you really wanted to go somewhere by yourself, I know you 
would come back.  And I would miss you while you were gone!  I cannot imagine 
wanting to go on a trip without you, and I don't consider myself a 
"wanderer," either.
