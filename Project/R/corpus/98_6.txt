Jill:

You are right.  Once this is assigned it cannot be used by ENA.  If everyone 
is fine with that, then there should be no issues.

If it is OK w/ Legal, then it is OK w/ me. The only question I have is that 
if we assign it to ENA Upstream, can they still do business w/ ENA..? (That's 
why we were doing a new one anyway...plus I don't think the old one had our 
riders)..., but again, if it is OK w/ you, it is OK w/me!
