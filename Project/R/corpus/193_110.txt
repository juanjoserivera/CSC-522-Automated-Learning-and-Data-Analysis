After talking with Ken and our Gas Control it appears we had and operater error, a setpoint was put in at the TW mainline.  The problem
was corrected and the plant pressure came back.  We think with an open line of communications between the plant and gas control
we hope to minimize the mistakes.  If any other concerns please call.
