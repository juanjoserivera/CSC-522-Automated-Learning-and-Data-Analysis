Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice.
