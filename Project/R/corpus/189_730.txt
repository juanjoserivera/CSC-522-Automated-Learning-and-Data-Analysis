Michelle, Gail and Richard:
As per Bob's suggestion, I am coordinating directly with the three of you to
arrange a meeting with me and one of my senior partners from
Brobeck-Austin's complex commercial litigation group.  The morning of April
27 works on our calendars for a meeting at your offices in Houston.  Please
let me know if this works for the three of you.  Thanks..........Jarvis
