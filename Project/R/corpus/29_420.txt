Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.  I have spoken to Roger 
Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine 
installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market 
commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the 
EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction 
pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt 
apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued 
about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will 
happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK.  
If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the 
permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm 
decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and 
request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that 
if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit 
automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions 
of the existing permit for the facility..

John, I agree with your points.  Has EPA already been notified?  If not, we 
should put the proper spin on it, which, in my opinion, should come from 
Marketing.  Something like, "we tried hard, and continue to try hard, to sell 
more capacity, but the market has not cooperated, so we must defer (not 
cancel) the station for now.  We haven't even told FERC yet, so you are the 
first to know."

Jerry
