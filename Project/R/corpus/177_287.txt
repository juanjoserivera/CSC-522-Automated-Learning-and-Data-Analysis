I'd like to come to Mo Vino - can I register with you (as a co-host)?

don't know about cooking class - i'm not feeling well - what's the topic?

Cooper,

Yes, I am going to cooking this evening.

I always go to Mo Vino since I am co-host.
Last night, Alaina and I picked out the wines.
Looks like a pretty good selection. I think you should come.

Craig
