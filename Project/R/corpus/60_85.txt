Bob. 

I could have sworn that I sent you this information earlier.  But I can't find it in my e-mail anywhere, so here it is:

Highest Priority
El Paso Gas Transmission Texas Pipeline (formerly PGE Texas and Valero)	Hub contract, Park & Lend contracts, inter- and intrastate transport
East Texas Gas Transmission (Duke Energy Field Services)			Cartwheel agreement, transport

Secondary Priority
Guadalupe Pipeline (Duke Energy Field Services)					Intra- and interstate transport
Oasis Pipeline									"	"	"	"
TXU Gas Distribution (Lone Star Pipeline)						"	"	"	"
Houston Pipe Line								"	"	"	"
El Paso Field Services Channel							"	"	"	"
Oneok Westex (Westar)								"	"	"	"
Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (Midcon)						"	"	"	"
Tejas Pipeline

The contracts on the pipes listed under "Highest Priority" are required for us to trade in the 3 main areas in Texas (EOL).  We must have these on day one.  The secondary contracts/pipes will be used soon after start up and are ranked in order of importance.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Again, I thought that I sent this to you a couple of weeks ago. Sorry for the delay.
