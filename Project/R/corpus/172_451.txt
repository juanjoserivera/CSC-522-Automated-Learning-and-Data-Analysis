hey denise,

i just wanted to say that i am alive and well
thank you for all of the sweet messages that you have left
they have brightened up my day everytime
I have been very busy with all the flood stuff and will soon 
be packing up whats left in the house to take it to storage
Kay and my self are still very dayd to day

I LOVE YOU NISE
