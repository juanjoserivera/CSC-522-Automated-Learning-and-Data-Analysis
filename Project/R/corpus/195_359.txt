hey courtney,

i'm sorry i didn't reply back to you sooner, but i'm sure you'll understand when i say that things with work have been a bit on the crazy side.  i'd like to attend tonight, but have a bit of a scheduling conflict.  i was wondering if it would be alright if i showed up between 7:30-8:00 rather than at 7:00.  also, where exactly are the festivities going to be held?

thanks,
susan
