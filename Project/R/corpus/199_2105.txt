Jean-Pierre:

We are faxing the FIMAT USA futures customer agreement to you now.
Marie Heard will be assisting me in forwarding required documentation.  Enron North America Corp. will provide authorization (corporate and trading).  We will call you shortly about the full package.

Thanks for your help.
