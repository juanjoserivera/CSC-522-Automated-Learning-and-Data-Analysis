Sandeep,

This looks great. I would talk to all the heads of structuring desks, including
the right persons (Zimin, Krishna, Vasant) in the conversations.
Also, please talk to Andrea Reed and ask who are good targets in the EIM 
organization.

We can talk about other targets when I get back.

Vince
