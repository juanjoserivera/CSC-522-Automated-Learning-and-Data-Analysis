I got the agreement this morning but they misspelled Roseville!!  I am having them change it and will email it to you when I get it.  Do you want me to send you a hard copy or is an email version ok with you?

Let me know -

Thanks,

Kim

PS How are things?

Hi Kim.  Anything working on the gas master agreement?  Just a small
reminder.
