Hi Larry

I haven't talked to Bill, but everyone else is OK with letter.  I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks
