Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!
