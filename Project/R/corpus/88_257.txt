Credit has been instructed that either Rick Buy or Bill can sign the CA's.  Since these were strictly for financials (and signed by Enron Corp.), we weren't going to enter them into our database, but Kay Young is going to keep a copy in her files.  Do you have any suggestions or comments otherwise?
