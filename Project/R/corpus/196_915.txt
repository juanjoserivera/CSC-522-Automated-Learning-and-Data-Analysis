Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging in the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance, am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)  Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.  As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestions... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa, Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above, in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill, also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night.  

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help out with a few suggestions.

Love,
Susan
