Jim,

This is very helpful. I already forwarded my resume to the Tektronix contact you told me. I am forwarding you a copy of my resume as well just in case you something good crosses your way. I appreciate your help a lot. 
This whole thing with my company happened so fast and caught me off guard.- a lesson for next time-.

Anyways please continue to keep in touch. I will do the same and keep you posted. You know we really do not want to go back home right now. I have a list of things I haven't accomplished yet.

Thanks,
Monika
