Dear Pam:

Thank you for your e-mail of August 15th.  It is always a pleasure to hear from former employees.  Thank you also for calling attention to instances which, on the surface, do not appear to be representative of our expectations of Enron leadership.

Part of our continuous improvement involves an on-going review of our management and the diversity of styles therein.  True, not everyone is agreeable to Enron's culture or the many different management styles at Enron.  We do, however, expect all of our employees - not just management - to adhere to our core values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.  These values become even more significant as we continue to grow and expand our scope of business, and more critical as we become a more culturally diverse workforce.

We enjoy our status as one of the best places in America to work according to Fortune and other sources thanks in part to our willingness to examine our organization and make needed change.  Our employee surveys, belief in open communication, and exit interview process for employees choosing to leave Enron are examples of our efforts to seek out feedback and scrutinize the way we do business.  Your feedback will help play a role in that process.

Sincerely,

Ken Lay
