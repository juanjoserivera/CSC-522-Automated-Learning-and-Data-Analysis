Appreciate the speedy response.  Actually, it's a "personal" event opposed to 
a business reason, and though important, I don't think it clears your 
hurdle.  No problem.  Never hurts to inquire, and I appreciate the 
consideration.

Best,
Jeff

I would rather you not.  My policy on these matters goes something like
this. If you have a valid reason like you are out of town on business, then
you can take the exam by fax as close to the actual time as possible,
certainly on the same day.
