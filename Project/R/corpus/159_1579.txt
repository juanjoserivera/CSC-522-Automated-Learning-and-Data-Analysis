The only way would be to copyright the material.  Any original writing can be copyrighted.  At a minimum, I would mark any submission as Copyrighted material.  I don't know the specific requirements for filing.  You might want to do some net research on the subject.  I would think the Fed. Government would have a web site on how to copyright material.  Hope this helps.
