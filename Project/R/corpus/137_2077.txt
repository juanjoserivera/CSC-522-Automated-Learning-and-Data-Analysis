1.  Need details re item 1  below.  Please suggest language (band of 
acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate.

6.  Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies?

7. Bogey calc only addresses gas.  What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil?  
Does the fuel cost and heat rate change?

Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it 
is.  I did  a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn 
to locate it.

Thanks,

Kay
