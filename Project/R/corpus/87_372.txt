This is very confidential at this point in time.   Do not forward.     Be prepared to discuss the job that each does and what we need to do to be able to transition early monday am if not before.    Call me.   This is what I am trying to reach you about.    The assumed time frame for this is next week.

My numbers are as follows:
try this one first:    936-597-3905

Happy Thanksgiving,
