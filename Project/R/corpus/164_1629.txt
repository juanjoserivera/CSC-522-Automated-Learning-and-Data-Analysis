Please forward originals  to my attention (see my  add in email).  In addition, please remove "Draft" and "For Discussion Purposes Only" from  the agreements. Send two signed originals and I will forward one fully executed contract for your records.  Many thanks for your assistance in this matter.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.
