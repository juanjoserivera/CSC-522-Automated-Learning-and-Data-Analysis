Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of 
the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to 
find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back 
in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My 
apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your 
patience.  SRS
