Hi there,

Thanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to Enron.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.

Italy is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  Florence is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.

Sounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.

Well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  I keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.

It was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!

Sean
