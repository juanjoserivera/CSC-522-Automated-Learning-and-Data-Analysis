Mr. Stewart, as per you voice mail request to me on Feb. 20, 2001, attached 
is the correspondance concerning the reqeust to replace the mixing valves 
with carbuerators at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.   The players 
in this activity included Jon Fields of Argent Consulting.  Due to the fact 
that the pre testing data for the emissions from the mixing valves and the 
post testing data for emissions from the carbuerators were received in hard 
copy only, I am not able to provide this as an attachment.  This data was, 
however, sent to you via fed-x on January 24, 2001.  If needed, I can 
resubmit the results of the data for your review.   As expected, the 
emissions levels did decrease when the carbs were installed. 

Please reveiw the attached correspondance concerning the request to replace 
the mixing valves at the Spraberry Plant (TNRCC account No. ML-0022-W) with 
carbuerators without requiring involvement of a permitting activity.  Thank 
you for your consideration in this issue.
