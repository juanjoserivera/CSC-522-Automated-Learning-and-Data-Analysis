I think that it would be best for the Chancellor's office to make the 
contact/request, but if you need us to help, then Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro or 
I can make a go of it; but again, I think that it would best for the 
Chancellor's office to make the invite.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Thank you - Kari certainly seems to be an ideal candidate.  Who would the 
appropriate person be from Enron to initiate contact with Kari regarding the 
request?  Once initial contact is made, I can follow up with details.

Tom
