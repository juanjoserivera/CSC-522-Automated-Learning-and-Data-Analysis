Scottie,

Como va todo por all?? Todo bien?
Estas ganando mucha plata? Yo no.

Hey, I think we might be going to Houston during the next week to see how EOL 
works there...you know we will implement EOL here in BA.....we have a great 
market for EOL, don%t you think so?? Este mercado es una mierda!!!

Just wanted to let you know that. I hope eveything is going good. Hope to see 
you next week.

Un abrazo,

Rolo
