Decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her.  I suppose that if she wants 
others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of 
packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake 
that we can!  (Do you think that we will be invited?)  That really sounds 
ugly, and I don't mean it to.  I think that your idea was a great one, but if 
she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.  Let me 
know when the deliberation process is completed!  --Sally

Sally,

Let's reserve that last weekend.  Saturday would be fine with me.  You need
to know that I got an email from Cara--she's had a couple of offers for
showers--and is having a hard time deciding what to do (hmm...what a
surprise!).  Anyway, am not sure where our offer stands--we'll see.  I told
her to do whatever is best for her (while thinking:  if she doesn't choose
our shower invitation it will affect my gift!)

Will try to pin her down...

Cindy
