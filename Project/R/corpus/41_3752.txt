Thanks, Evie.
 
1) If someone writes a decent appeal, might you folks be interested in signing?
2) Do you have Michael's # where I can reach him tomorrow.  Sorry for the bother.  And if you'd like to hear about what we're thinking about regarding QFs, be happy to share it with you as well.
 
Be safe,
Jeff
