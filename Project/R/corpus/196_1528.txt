The Word of the Day for April 7 is: 

                  gadzookery  \gad-ZOO-kuh-ree\  (noun) 
                  : the use of archaisms (as in a historical novel) 

                  Example sentence:
                  "Get rid of the gadzookery," Bruce's editor cautioned.
                  "Mirabella can perfectly well say 'please' instead of 
'prithee.'" 

                  Did you know?
                  "Gadzooks . . . you astonish me!" cries Mr. Lenville in 
Charles
                  Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby. We won't accuse Dickens of
                  gadzookery ("the bane of historical fiction," as historical 
novelist
                  John Vernon called it in Newsday magazine), because we
                  assume people actually said "gadzooks" back in the 1830s.
                  That mild oath is an old-fashioned euphemism, so it is 
thought,
                  for "God's hooks" (a reference, supposedly, to the nails of 
the
                  Crucifixion). But it's a fine line today's historical 
novelist must
                  toe, avoiding expressions like "zounds" and "pshaw" and 
"tush"
                  ("tushery" is a synonym of the newer "gadzookery," which 
first
                  cropped up in the 1950s), as well as "gadzooks," while at 
the
                  same time rejecting modern expressions such as "okay" and
                  "nice."
