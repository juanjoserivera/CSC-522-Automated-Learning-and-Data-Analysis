I had a nice trip in.  I tried a slightly different route, and it was 
uneventful.  Kinda slick, though.

How much does it cost to mail a letter now?  Is is $.34?  Of course I have a 
bunch of 33 cent stamps.

I have no clue how much rock that would be.  I should measure the length of 
the beds, then I could compute how much to get, at least sort of.  There's 
some grass to be dug up also.  I think I will start with the Advil today!

I think you are right about the 1700...that's a lot rock!!

Michael saw Coach Chris getting out of his car this morning. Talk about
excited! I didn't think he could get out of the truck fast enough... I
walked the paper work to the school office.

Hope your trip in was not too bad. There were three accidents between school
and my office...
