Ken,
 
Thank you for your inquiry. I will do my best to answer your questions, but would prefer to answer your questions by phone. I feel that this will provide each of us with greater flexibility and likely will give me even more of an opportunity to answer your questions. I will usually be most available after 3 each day. You can reach me at 503-464-3730.
 
Thanks,
Bill
