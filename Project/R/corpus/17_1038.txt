Don't know what works best with your schedule.  Ernie Pitterelli (head of Operatins for UBS Americas) will be here on Monday and Tuesday and one of the things that we will discuss is the risk roles - position rerporting and calculation of P&L.  Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations, so it could be helpful for you to be here.  What was Wes' response?  --Sally
