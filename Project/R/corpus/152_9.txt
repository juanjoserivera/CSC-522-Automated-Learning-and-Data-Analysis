Hi Jan,

So nice to hear from you.  I am glad you are finally "enjoying life".  I wish I could join you now.  With the Enron stock and "whatnot", I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated (smile).  Are the boys excited about going to "MDO".  I bet that is a change for them, and alot less expensive for you.

The job is going well, I really like it, it is a different kind of stress, but definitely more preferable for me.  I really like what I'm doing.  My  boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.  Jordan is doing pretty good in school,  I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.   Kendall, what can I say?  My Kendall is something else.  He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!

Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.  Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.  I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.

Anyway, take care

Love ya!
