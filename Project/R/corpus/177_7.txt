hey mara,

i tried to call your phone number, but just got voicemail.  here are my numbers:  (w) 403 974 6946 (h) 403 262 0205 (c) 403 512 3312 - it would be good to chat, but i'll respond here in case you get this and not your voicemail.  also, a better email is "trycooper@hotmail.com" i've been meaning to write you (it's on my list) but haven't probly because i'm not sure what to say ... i'm glad you got in touch.  i hope you had fun in belize with your family.  i checked and i don't have brinda's email - sorry about that.  i might have her phone number athome, but that won't do you much good i don't think.  also if you are checking out SFSU, you may want to look up someone named Ingrid Binswanger - i went to college with her and she is ultra-cool and might be able to give you the lowdown.  i think she is doing some sort of joint degree and is probly still there - not sure though.  

um, yeah, i was a bit surprised when you mentioned the 8 year statistic! but i'm not sure what relevance that really has.  it's too bad things are rocky between you and steve, it seems like you've been together forever.  it was a crazy night and i don't know what else to say, hopefully we will stay in touch better as a result?  it's funny to think that i've known you half of my life at this point.  of course, however you want to handle it is fine by me.  well, if you get this while you are in portland or sf, give me a buzz and i'll tell you what i can, otherwise, call or write and let's stay in touch.  good luck shopping for programs.
