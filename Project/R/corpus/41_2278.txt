Jeff-
I am always interested! The angle we are looking for is the natural gas
marketing side of things. Are YOU still interested? YES.  And I am getting you
because you are afraid to expose anyone else from your company to the
wildness and unpredictability of the AB 1890 Group? NO--I worried about 
exposing the staid Sacramento types to high-strung Enron people. (kidding--I 
can provide what you need on the market stuff):)
