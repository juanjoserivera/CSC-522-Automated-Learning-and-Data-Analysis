Jennie - This looks okay if I wait for my husband or Liz to go on the 20th -- although I think the return would need to be extended a  day or so.
 
Could you also see about if I am traveling alone and wanted to change my ticket to leave Sat.  I was searching the Internet and it looks like the Lufthansa flight is still available on Sat.
 
I need to make some quick decisions about what I'm doing tomorrow.
