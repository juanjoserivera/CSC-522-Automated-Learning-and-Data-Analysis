Hey woman!  Things are going good, ok at work, better at home.  Not too too busy but I'm actually doing stuff.   Well, this is my last weekend as a lone bachelor.  NONO, we aren't getting married, yet.  I move out of my little 522 sq ft cubby hole into a 2 bedroom in her apartment complex.  She moves into it on the 22nd.  Ahhhhh the good life.  I knew it couldn't last forever.  I getting ready for some fighting too.  We have 3 TV's.  What's wrong with a TV in each bedroom?????   I tell you we are gonnnnnna fight!@#

How are things with you?
