Scott please provide Ina and the assistants with the info they need to start the churns.  They must be submitted by NOON today.  I have to meet with the move team to work the timing issues.  

The trading simulation is already at risk as all commercial people may not be relocated by Thurs.

Thanks,
Tammy
