I agree with the content of John's e-mail except for the pricing delivery date. I will not have the pricing completed until sometime late Monday night. I am in flight to Houston until 2:00CST, at which point I will be in meeting until late Monday evening. I looked at the queries this weekend, so it should not take long to put the necessary fixes in place.  Everyone on this e-mail will have the pricing information in their e-mail when they walk in on Tuesday morning. I apologize if I did not make that clear during our phone conversation. Also, I would like to have a discussion at some point on how we will handle this customer going forward. My thanks to John for taking the time to clarify my concerns.
