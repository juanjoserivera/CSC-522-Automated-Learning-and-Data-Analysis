Keith:
Thanks for your prompt response.  I can respond to some of your comments.

1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed 
Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration.  From a credit 
standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger.

2. I will check with Ed on point #2.

3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting 
an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian 
counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept 
cash collateral from Canadian counterparties.  With respect to surety bonds, 
there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a 
surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.  For this 
reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral.

4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.

All of the other points need to be discussed.  Can we now schedule a call for 
later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues?  Please 
let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach.  I am not in the 
office on Mondays.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol, thanks for your list. I have inserted some comments/responses on a
preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues.
I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your
email.
