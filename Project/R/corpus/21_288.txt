if that works for you.  Thanks. Lynn

Due to the June 1 changes in Shelley's organization, I'll need your
timekeepers to give me your new payroll distribution percentages.  I'm
preparing a new "budget" for Shelley, and would appreciate this
information by the end of this week if possible.

Sheila, I'm sorry I didn't respond to your call last week.  I was on
vacation, and forgot to change my phone greeting.
Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,
Nancy (x36311)
