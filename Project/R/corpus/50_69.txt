Well, I can't meet at 10:00.  Steve just asked me to attend a "Stan restructuring" meeting for him at 10:00 (Steve's on vacation).  I'd say let's reschedule for this afternoon, but I want to wait to see if there's anything we have to do ASAP from this meeting this afternoon.  Let me get back with you.
