Soussan,

It seems we have planned for all contingencies. 
Look forward to meeting you next week.

Vince,

Your suggested arrangement is perfect with me and I love both Italian or
Steak... the choice is yours.  I really look forward to our meeting & I will
be @ the hotel's reception area on time.  It's great that I have your
cell-phone...as a contingency, and just in case you needed to call me, it's
best to leave me a message @ my phone # @ work.
