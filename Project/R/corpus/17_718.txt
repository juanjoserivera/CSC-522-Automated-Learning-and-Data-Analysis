You are welcome to attend any of these.  In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.  Do get with Jeff and Stacey before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.  

PATTI:  Please add Beth to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.  Thanks.
