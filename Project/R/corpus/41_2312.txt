Hope you guys had a wonderful weekend at the dome.? Is the deck completely 
finished now??? Vegas was awesome, of course.? I ended up a couple hundred or 
so.? Craps was king.

?

On the business side(WE MUST CLOSE THIS DEAL WITH ENRON.? This is SO 
important for us.? It looks like things really went well and they have our 
pilot proposal.? Is there ANYTHING you can do??? Anything to get to someone 
who is a part of this group and just say random great things about us or help 
move it forward.? We have to close two deals before the next board meeting (4 
weeks out) or we have to downsize again.? It won,t be pretty.? Is there 
anyone you know or who might know someone to help this out?? Maybe you get 
Lay to put a little pressure on.? Ha!

?

Back to the personal(PP wanted to have a steak dinner to try out the knives 
early this week.? How about tomorrow night?? I,ll make a nice mushroom sauce??

?
