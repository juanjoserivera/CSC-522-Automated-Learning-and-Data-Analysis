Good Morning Lauren,

I was glad to hear from you and to find out your not hurt this morning.  I will make this short and to the point. I know people can read your e-mail so I trust you will know what I'm talking about if I don't write it)  I want you to know that I'm not mad at you for the decisions you have made, although I don't understand them.  You were saying one thing while thinking another and if things would have been different yesterday would you be making the same decision today?  I wanted to do things right thing this time and now it seems I won't get the chance.  Maybe things happened for the best, because if things would have different yesterday I think you would have called me with a different decision and now I know by your actions it would not have been right choice.  I don't think you have followed through but I wanted you too more than anything.  Lauren, I hope you are doing the right thing for YOU.  I know life comes down to a few moments and this is one of them.  I believe in "FATE" do you?

-Me

P.S. I found what you were missing.............
