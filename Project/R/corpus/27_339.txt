Thanks for note. I recall our conversation. I've had surgery but as you know the worry is did they get it all? Surface tissue of tongue on bottom right. This is so weird since I don't smoke or dip which are the primary risk factors. Thanks for your concern and I will let you know how this goes. I have found that information control is critical so please don't discuss with anyone. I go back to MDA in a month for follow-up visit (ultra sound of lymph nodes). Rick
