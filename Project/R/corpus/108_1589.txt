I don't think I need new tires, unless I'm surprised.  You might want to buy 
an extra tire in case you get a flat.  I think I loaned Harry my old spare 
tire.  Anytime Saturday is fine...

I have a tire pump, but I could take it to Bikesport and have new ones put
on it and have it checked out.

What do you think?  Could I check it out on Saturday?
