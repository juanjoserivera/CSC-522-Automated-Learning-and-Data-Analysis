Geiv,
	From the discussion that I just had with Pam, this does not seem to be clearly the case. She will do further research and see if there is an issue with Ibook, but you need to give some examples of how you came to such a clear conclusion.  This is something that should have been done some time ago. What I expect is that you and Pam will work together to come up with an efficient solution. It was also brought to my attention that you want to minimize the time you spend on this process, I would agree with that. I have given Pam the same instructions so I would expect to see this process  finely tuned in very near future.
