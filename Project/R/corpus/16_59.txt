Chuck,

I have been on vacation since the middle of last week.  I have now received your multiple emails and vmails.  As you are well aware Enron is dealing with a multitude of challenges at the current time.  I appreciate your and Miles' patience regarding the possibility of Enron creating and trading a TradersNews Cinergy product on EOL.  We are currently still evaluating the TradersNews historical data and market conditions pertaining to the viability of such a product.  I will contact you as soon as I am able to move forward with this project on this side.  The best way to reach me is currently via e-mail.

Thanks,

Don Baughman
