Subject: "What To Expect In Western Power Markets This Summer" Conference and 
Other Upcoming Events





Dear Electric Power Industry Colleague:

Soaring natural gas prices, heat waves, plant outages, low hydropower  
availability, capacity shortages ) many unexpected factors combined to send  
Western power prices upward last summer. In addition to fundamental factors,  
flaws in market rules and market power are also considered by many observers 
to  have been significant causes. Western power markets continued to hold 
surprises  in the fall and winter, as lower load levels did not result in the 
expected  moderation of prices. Unprecedented gas market price spikes, and a 
credit crisis  due to the near-bankruptcy of California utilities, were added 
to the complex  mix of market drivers.

Electric Utility Consultants, Inc. (EUCI) is organizing a conference to  
address these complex issues ) "What to Expect in Western Power Markets This 
Summer." The conference will bring together market forecasters, system  
operators, regulators, monitors, buyers, sellers and other industry experts 
to  present and discuss the latest facts, policies, and forecasts. 
Presentations and  panel discussions will cover supply, demand and price 
forecasts; how the Western  markets work when capacity is short; changes to 
ISO rules and regulatory  policies; and FERC,s price mitigation measures. In 
addition, a session will  cover longer term developments in the western 
markets.

Attend EUCI,s timely conference, "What To Expect in Western Power Markets 
This Summer" to get as clear a picture as is likely to be available.
