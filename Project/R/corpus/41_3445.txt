talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  and we're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.
 
how's things?
