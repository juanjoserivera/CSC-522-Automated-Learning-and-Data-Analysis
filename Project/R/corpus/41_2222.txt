Yes, my trunk can handle that easily.  Sounds like a plan!  I'm going to 
inform folks that I will be off Thursday/Friday.  I'll let you what reaction 
I get.

you were the one who made her day by being so sweet to her!  It was a fun
day though.  Wednesday night sounds great - we will do our best to get stuff
ready to go.  You would have to turn on the frig immediately though -
because you'll have to take up the cooler with the turkeys in it.  They will
be frozen and just need to be in a frig until Saturday.   Remind Prentice to
get the cooler!  As far as the booze goes, we can send all that so the only
big thing would be the rest of the food and your trunk is pretty good size -
right??
