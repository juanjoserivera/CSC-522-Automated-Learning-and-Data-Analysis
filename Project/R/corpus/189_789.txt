Call Guidry. Bruce is probably relieved he doesn't have to complete another form. I also left you a VM on the propsed McCartney trip. I need you to coordinate through Stephanie so we can get the dates set in stone.

I haven't completed any of mine.  Our understanding down here is that we got an extension.  Do you mean call Guidry or Lundstrom?  Do I need to do something on line?
