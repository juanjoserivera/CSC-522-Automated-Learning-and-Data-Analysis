That would be great if you could tell me.  I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th, and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th.  I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.  Let me know.  You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday, enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days.
