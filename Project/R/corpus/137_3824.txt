Don't know the answers. We need to visit with Herman Manis to get his buy-in 
on an approach.  I have a call in to him on another transaction, so I'll 
ask.  Are you in Houston today?

Subject: SDEC: Certosa Holdings Option Agreement

Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration 
and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement?  I got a call from 
the owner of Certosa Holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those 
legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this 
agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell 
them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy 
Milligan. AEW's assistant to locate the Shutts & Bowen invoice.  

I understand we have engaged Shutts & Bowen in Tallahassee to review some 
property tax issue.  Cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet 
hard cost thang?
