I say go ahead with the call to work through any nits etc.  We will need a 
follow up call anyway, once we know what to do to meet the accting 
objectives.  This means you won't be available at 200 to talk with the accts, 
but that's ok.  

Finalizing the extension sounds good to me.

Subject: RE: Northwestern

Do you want me to postpone the call (I expect they are flexible)?.  Do you
want me to listen in on the meeting with the accountants?

Do you want me to communicate with Marguerite to get the extension in shape
for signing?
