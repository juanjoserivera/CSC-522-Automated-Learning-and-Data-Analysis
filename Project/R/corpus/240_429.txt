Gerald, 

I sent the following email to Jeff Hodge and Jason Williams on October 25th ad have heard nothing.  I reminded them this morning as we need to reply by mid next week.  Also, LDWP will be in our offices Monday afternoon.  Is this something that you can address faster than Jeff?  If so, just let him know and let me know how to proceed.  There was an article in the NGI publication this morning regarding this.

Thanks,

Kim
