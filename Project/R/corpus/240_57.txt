Thanks so much for sending the CDs.  I really didn't think I would ever see them again!  I take it that you are still considering coming back to windjammer.  I guess it will depend on what happens when you get home.  Kim 1, Stacy, Susie and I are considering the Poly trip in January.  I haven't been to those islands (St. Martin, St. Barts, etc.) yet so I might have to go.

I can't imagine a place better than the caribbean - I would love to see it!  So if you're not serious - don't tease me!

Take care and thanks again for the CDs -
Love,
K2
