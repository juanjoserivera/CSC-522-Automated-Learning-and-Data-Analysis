Thanks. You're call.  Might be a good idea to talk with him in advance.  Let me know what you think. Or, given the time crunch, just contacting his office to find out what his angle will be would be helpful--I also assume he'll spend his time 1) singing PA's praises and 2) claiming that DA can work, if done right, both of which are great messages.

Best,
Jeff
