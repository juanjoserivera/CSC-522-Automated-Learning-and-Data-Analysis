                            Hello  Mr. Kaminski,

                               Can we  meet for a quick lunch again at your 
convenience? Just to bring you up to date about my search for the right 
opportunity. Also I noticed in the Risk magazine that Enron Investment 
Partners and AIG have joined TreasuryConnect as strategic partners to 
capitalize on internet-based transaction execution of financial derivatives. 
I would like to explore if I can be any help to Hank Finkenstaedt, the 
Director of Enron Investment Partners.

                            Please let me know what day and time might be 
convenient for you.


Thank you.

Sincerely,
