Tracy, how is this:

Regarding the "Transfer" language for Allegheny (Party B), we have the 
following proposal:

"Party B may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in 
whole but not in part, to any Affiliate provided that (1) such transfer will 
not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default, and (2) (i) the 
creditworthiness of the Affiliate is not materially weaker than that of Party 
B immediately prior to such transfer, unless Party B provides a satisfactory 
guaranty or credit support to the Affiliate, or (ii) the proposed Affiliate 
satisfies the criteria that Party A applies in deciding whether to offer or 
make an extension of credit or to enter into transactions similar to the 
Transactions subject to the proposed transfer."
