Regarding SJ,  the Master Gas agreement as drafted and sent to the customer included a Gty to ENA for 7mm.  As stated below, Darren has requested a Gty from SJ to ENA for 8mm that covers physical gas and financial trades.  Have they sent us a gty or are your drafting one?  In any case please let me know.  I need to revise my draft and secure a copy for use as an exhibit to my Master.

Thanks
