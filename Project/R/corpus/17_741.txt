I remember you well, Christine, from the recruiting process.  I would love to visit with you to catch up on what you have done at Enron to date and to talk with you about a rotation in my group.  By copy of this memo, I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to get together.  I look forward to seeing you.  --Sally
