Wednesday is out for me, but Thursday, October 18 and Friday, October 19 both work.  I will tentatively hold both days until I hear back from you.  Thanks.  --Sally 

Also, great job on organizing the CHF event.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the people I met and the discussion that we had have certainly created a lot of food for thought.  I am in the midst of budgets this week, but will check with you next week on getting our boys together.
