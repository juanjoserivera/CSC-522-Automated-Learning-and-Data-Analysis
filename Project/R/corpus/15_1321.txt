He's doing ok.  He doesn't really like his job too much.  He is going to wait 
it out another month to see if a new position comes available.  If not, he is 
applying with dell and gateway for positions in Austin and Colorado.  I think 
he took a liking to one of my girl friends from work last night so I am 
waiting to hear about that.

By the way, have you seen Enron's stock the last two days.  It has gone from 
53 to 72.  It 's good to work for the big E!
