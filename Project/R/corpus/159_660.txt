True.  Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to 
chum the waters a little.  Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.  Maybe I go back 
to work after that or maybe I don't.  No other three Czech brothers can 
cruise so successfully in tight slacks!

Things are going well with little Cynthia.  She is really fun and easy to 
talk to.  I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each 
others company.

I too, am somewhat hesitant about those large toothed critters, although I'm
sure they'd much rather chomp into Eric's ass-steak rather than my boney
carcass.  I figure if everyone else does it why shouldn't we?

As for lunch, I'd like to get together although we break for lunch around 11
over here and that's more like breakfast for you fat-cat lawyer-types.  I'm
down here all week, so let me know if you want to try for something.  Maybe
Friday would be fun?  I'd have a lot more flexibility in my schedule on that
day.

Looks like Saturday is "pay your friend-dues day" at the Gillaspie Ranch.
Seems like all I do is move his ass.  All I know is that he better keep us
well hydrated.

Anywho, what's up with you and the little lady?  She seemed really together.
Hope things are progressing well--if that's your intentions.

Audi 5000,
Ryan
