If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone #  44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.  And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.  But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers.
