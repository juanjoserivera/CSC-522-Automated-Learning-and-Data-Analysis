I have talked to Sierra Pacific and they have some storage... I will advise.

I think fuller was doing some leg work also.

Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?

Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen?
