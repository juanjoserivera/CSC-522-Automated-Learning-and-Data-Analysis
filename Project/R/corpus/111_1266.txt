Mr. Kaminski;

 I am a Research Associate at Meridien Research
(www.meridien-research.com) in the greater Boston Area. We specialize in the
reporting and analysis of technology in the financial service industry.  I
work in the Risk and Trading Group.
 Currently I am working on a report on Energy Risk Applications.  I
introduced myself to Mr. Scott Neal who informed me that I should contact
you (see below). I would like to spend some time talking to you about
Enron's risk management for energy trading.  And if possible, I would like
to be able to include Enron in my report since they are the global leader in
Energy.
 If it is possible, I would like to talk this week.  My calendar is
pretty open so whenever you would like to talk.  I think the conversation
should take about 45 minutes to an hour.  If you would like a list of
questions, I would be more than happy to provide them.
 I can be reached at 617-796-2830 or dkovelsky@meridien-research.com.
 I look forward to talking to you,

Cheers,

Damon Kovelsky
