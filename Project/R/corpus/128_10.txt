Diem,

Not much going on at work.  Brushing up on meteorology 101 and discussing Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.  I have been going to work for only a few hours a day.  Some days I don't go in at all.  Right now, we are waiting for the Judge to approve the sale to UBS.  I think we would get our offers from them sometime soon after.  I have been using the free time to do a little travelling.  We went on a cruise in December and this week I am going to Chicago the 17 - 21.  I plan to go to Boston in February to see my family.  Anyway, my work number is 713-853-6278.

Talk to you soon.

Andy


P.S. Guess what these are:   .................
