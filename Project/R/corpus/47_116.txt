Bill, thank you.  I should have mentioned in my earlier message that my travel agent did tell me about that flight, but I determined that it was not practicable to rely on it for two reasons: (1) if it were to be cancelled, I would have no way of getting back in time for the Monday meeting, and (2) if it were not cancelled, the most-of-the-night journey back would not leave me in the condition I need to be in to participate effectively in the meeting. I do very much appreciate your efforts.  My best to you and Mary.  Jim
