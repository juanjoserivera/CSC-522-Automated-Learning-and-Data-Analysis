Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.
