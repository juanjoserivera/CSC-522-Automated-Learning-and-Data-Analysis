Agghh!

Tried to protest the move, saying that I couldn't make it to the Tuesday
meeting, so she switched me to yet another team - which I will not mention -
that couldn't have been worse if I had hand picked it.  So I told her that a
phone call came in that confirmed I could change my plans and I am back to
the second team - with Courtney, Kimberley, and Anil Sama.  It's a good
team, though not as good as my first!  :)

Oh, well!
