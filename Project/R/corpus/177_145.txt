gotcha.  hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile.  

alberta's great.  getting very cold here, but it's been puking in the mountains, so i'm looking forward
to getting out skiing, etc.  with the nosedive enron is taking, it's easy to blow out of work and head
to banff.  

alberta just built a 40MW wind farm (doubling wind capacity in the region) with more on the way.  should
be over 1% of installed capacity for the region soon.  

have fun in mejico.
