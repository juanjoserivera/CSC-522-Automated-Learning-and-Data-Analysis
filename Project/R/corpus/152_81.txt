Hope, Hope, Hope,

The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about the cost, I just want to look good!)

What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as well.  That boy is a mess!

Talk to you soon!


P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!
