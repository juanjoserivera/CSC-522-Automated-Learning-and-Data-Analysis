Tricia,

I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.

Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND
Duty on this amount = 3300
GST on this amount = 3800
Excise tax = 180
Permits = 400

Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500

That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.

Hardly seems like the best option.

Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:

Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)
Flight = $1500 CND
Hotel = $1500 CND
October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)

The total of the above is $11 800.
