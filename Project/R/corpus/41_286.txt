Jeff-
I think their predictions are correct about members getting active -- though
next week is mostly ceremonious I do expect there to be many bills
introduced on the subject. I agree that the agenda looks ambitious but our
hope is directly in line with yours -- the material is background for what I
hope is lively and productive discussion. Glad you can make it. See you
there!

Delaney
