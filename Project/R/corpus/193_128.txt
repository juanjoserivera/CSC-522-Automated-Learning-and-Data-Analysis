We need to be able to monitor everything there is to see just as we would monitor a TW on NNG interconnect.  
Along with the below mentioned items from Ben, we also need  All Accums, (previous and current 
mmbtu and mmcf), All Flows both MMbtu and MMcf. on all runs, 2" rotary, 4" turbine meter, 10" ultra-sonic.
All available History info..  This information request is for monitoring TW and El Paso at the Griffith Site.
Gary, Steve, Dale please review and if you think we need anything else, now is the time to speak up.  We
need as much information as possible to insure a smooth transition for gas control.  From what TW is 
hearing we could take over the operation sometime next week.  
Dale once we have the additional requests, will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to.  I will be 
glad to help.
