Stephanie:

This is like a very complicated game of musical chairs.  Right now there are 
people in the offices that have been designated for Michelle and Gail.  We 
can't move you guys in until we move them out.  We can't move them out yet 
because we don't have any more places to move people!  There is a design that 
has been drawn up to create some additional space (essentially by shrinking a 
lot of other spaces) which I hope will be built out by mid March.  That's the 
best I can do right now.  Sorry for the confusion.

Mark

Janette Elbertson advised that you are the planning person for the space over 
on 38.; Gail Brownfeld, Michelle Blaine and myself will be moving over to 38 
and some point in the near future.; Would you be able to tell me if a 
definite date (or ballpark date) has been scheduled?; Thank you for your 
help.;
