Yes,  the agreement was under ENA.  The confirmation / contracts are on Stacy's desk for signature. The customer signed the contract/confirm with ENA !!  I question if this is really suppose to be ENA Upstream?    This deal was done with John Singer??  Can you speak with these guys?  Let me know as the contract and confrim has been signed.
