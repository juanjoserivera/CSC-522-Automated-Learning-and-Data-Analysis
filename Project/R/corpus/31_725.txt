Linda,

I can't make 10 tomorrow, so go ahead and meet without me.

Lunch this week would be difficult, as I'm out Thursday and Friday attending the SW Legal Foundation Labor seminar in Dallas.  Would you like to try something next week with me and Lizzette Palmer, my new attorney?  If so, have your assistant get with Twanda at 853-9402 to schedule, as Twanda works for both me and Lizzette.

Thanks.

Michelle
