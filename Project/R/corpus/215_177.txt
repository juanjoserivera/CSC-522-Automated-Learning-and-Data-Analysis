Rogers --

FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  

Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.

Thanks.
