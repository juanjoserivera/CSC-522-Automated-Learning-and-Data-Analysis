The word is that we are being purchased from the Enron estate and give Enron 1/3 profits for some term.  The deal goes in front of the bankruptcy judge on Friday.  Supposed to be a good deal.  

Do you need tix for the concert?  Do you have to work Friday?  What's the weather like?  Any good fishin hole to wade or drift?
