The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.

There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.

Please call with any questions.
