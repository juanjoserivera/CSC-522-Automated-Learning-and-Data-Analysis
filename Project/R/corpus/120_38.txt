Ok - this isn't dying.  I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.  West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?
