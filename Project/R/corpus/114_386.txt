Subject:	FW: Request for PR2 Access

Steve -- For your approval.  As some additional information regarding the request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed.  For the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed below.  Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group.  The people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department.  For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed.

I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well.  These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.  for the past week.

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.
Thanks.
Jo Ann
