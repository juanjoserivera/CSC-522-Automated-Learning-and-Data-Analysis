I know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.  I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that Jeff McMahon did receive the offer from the Royal Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of Enron accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.

Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.  Again, please send me your comments.  I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.
