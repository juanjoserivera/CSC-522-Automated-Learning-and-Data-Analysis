Count me in, but the dogs will probably have issues.  Talk to you later.

Subject:	FW: 4th of July


Todd is trying to reserve a large (sleeps 16 comfortably) cabin on Lake
Travis around the 4th of July holiday.  The 4th is on a Wednesday this year
so he'll probably reserve it through the proceeding or following weekend.
I'm just trying to get a head count for now so anyone interested please let
me know.

We rented this place a couple years ago and had a great time.  It's located
on the lake and has a private boat dock.  Todd will most likely have his
boat for skiing and cruising the lake.  Other activities include Jet Ski
rental, wind surfing rental, sun bathing, cooking out, and drinking.

John
