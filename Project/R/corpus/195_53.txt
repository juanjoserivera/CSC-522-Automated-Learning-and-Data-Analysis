As usual Alan, I am left somewhat disturbed by your words...and by the way, do you ever return phone calls?  As for the rest of you guys, I anxiously await our impending reunion in Cap City.  Glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay, with the exception of Emily who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever.  Jon Jon, went to an Astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special.  The trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly...seems you're not doing to shabby.  Congrats.  Life for me is pretty good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene).  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but things just seem to be getting less certain the older I get.  Don't want to get to heavy now...so I'll saw the really bleak stuff for Austin.

Ciao,
Sue
