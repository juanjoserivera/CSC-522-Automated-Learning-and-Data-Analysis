Thanks for note. I may need your help here as I won't be able to filter stuff as much as I usually do so if my guys are reviewing something that looks way off let me know. 

Also, spoke with Pug re joint meeting and he nthinks we need 2 hours for it and probably won't be able to discuss international assets and lessons learned this time around.Is there anyway we can increase time for joint meeting to 2 hours, and have audit and finance as well? Pug really wants to leave adequate time to discuss limits etc. He also wants to be sure that all BOD feel they are invited. How do we do that? Rick
