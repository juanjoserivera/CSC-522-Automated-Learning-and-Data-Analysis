Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.  

I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point.  
That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to 
law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 
years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of 
glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken 
down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed 
on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.

South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

hi gn. so funny...terry and david are in my group. i don't know david as
well really, but terry is a good friend and is a total riot! i don't know
how well you got to know him, but he really is just great. anyway, i have
really been working with enron south america on the cuiaba project
exclusively for the past year and a half. the enron attorneys are randy
young and john novak. prior to that i did a few structured deals --
christina mordaunt was the atty.

yes, annie wu (we just call her "the wu") is a stitch! remind me to tell you
the story about when she came to visit me in london...and a few other
stories. she is a trip! truly a sweet person and a good friend too. i heard
you know my friend walter daniel, too. he was in my law school class and is
also a good friend.

whenever/wherever on the 14th is fine. do you like sushi? we could go to
miyako...or zydeco or becks? those are the places where i usually meet enron
folks since they are in between... let me know! mb
