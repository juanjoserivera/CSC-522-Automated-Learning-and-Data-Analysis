That is funny.  I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.  You might want to sell them.  We were actually a skit last week on Saturday Night Live.  Pretty funny stuff.  Keep working on your wife about Jazz Fest.  Ash is working her too.
