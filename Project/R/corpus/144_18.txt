Jeff, 

Attached is a draft copy of a presentation that was created as an internal 
briefing document on the business activities within EGM.  The purpose of this 
presentation is to communicate our activities and provide individuals with a 
more detailed reference document on these businesses in case they come up in 
Q&A or if you need some quick facts about these businesses and I'm not 
around.   

This is a confidential and internal document, which includes earnings 
targets, goals and objectives.  We have a shorter more external version that 
we use to describe our businesses.  I can provide that copy if you are 
interested.

Please don,t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like 
to discuss this in more detail.  

Mike

PS - I will also send one of these to IR and PR
