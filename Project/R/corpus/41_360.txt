Dear John:
You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely 
upset.  

Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last 
week.  To wit:  according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents 
FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the 
alleged "overcharges."  John, combined, the government sellers, including CA 
munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, "overcharged" California by a 
factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have "overcharged."  
(See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.)

So notes like this, are ill-informed.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and 
others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and 
LADWP.  Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, "well, it's not the 
gouging.  that's not the problem.   it's the "profit motive" we've set up 
that's the problem."  so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't 
control.  everyone else is blood-sucking scum.  (in addition, please inform 
Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to 
others.  it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but 
getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR 
contract problem.)

Sorry for the flame, but it's gotten extremely tiresome, and  it ain't 
personal; but the emperor has no clothes, which will increasingly become 
increasingly apparent.

all that aside, we've got other work that's more important, and i look 
forward to continue working on it. 

best,
jeff
