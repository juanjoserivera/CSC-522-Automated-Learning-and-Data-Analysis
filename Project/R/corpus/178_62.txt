Hi Aunt Mary and Uncle Bob,  

            Sorry it has taken me so long to write.  Life is not good here at Enron.  I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold.  I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format.  Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people.  It was so sad the day they let all those people go.  I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job.  Dick's company has basically been shut down.  He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business.  His job will eventually end but we have no time frame.  I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation.  We had sold all our Enron stock in our 401K some time ago so we have done ok.
             It is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays.  Please tell them hello and MERRY CHRISTMAS.  It sounds like everyone is doing well.  Michele is disappointed we are not coming home for Christmas but Dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible.  He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working.  I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing.  Take care.

All our love.

P.S.  Next time I write I promise to be more upbeat.
