John,
     I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?

Dan
