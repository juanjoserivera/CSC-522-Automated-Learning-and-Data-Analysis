Hi
thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w CY.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought, rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion, but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...
