Hey Sister Sims,

You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.  She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.  

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk.  

Write back
