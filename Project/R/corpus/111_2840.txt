Ed,

Louise must be very busy. I sent her another message regarding your request.
I shall call her if there is no reply from her within 3 days. 

Please, let me know.

Vince

Gu est Access to Enrononline



Dear Vince,

I have not heard from Louise and assume I cannot access Enrononline. As a
result, I have written what I can discern in the attached draft chapter for
the Risk Guide to Electricity Hedging. Could you review the Enrononline
section and let me know if I have any factual errors? Obviously, I welcome
any other comments you might have.

Don't warry about any textual problems -- me editors will catch those.
English is, after all, my thrid language (he said, defensively).

Sorry I couldn't gain access. Enrononline looks interesting and the stock
market seems to be giving you a strong pat on the back. Well done.

Thanks for your help.

Ed Krapels
