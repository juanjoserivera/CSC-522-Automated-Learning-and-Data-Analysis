It's 11:55 am on Sunday - have tried your cell phone, but did not get an answer.  Left you a message that Beth, Jeff, and Brent are all here and working on their respective pieces.  We will convene as a group about 12:30 here in my office.  If you can join us at 1:00, we can give you an update.  --Sally
