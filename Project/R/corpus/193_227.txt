They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.  They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and
he didn't look at it.  I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes 
for a 24 hr period.  Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.  I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain
how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.
