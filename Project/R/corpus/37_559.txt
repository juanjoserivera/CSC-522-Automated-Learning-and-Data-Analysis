We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!
 
If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?
 
Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).
