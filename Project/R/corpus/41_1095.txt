Hi Tom:

From our contact with the Governor's office, seems that Kari Dohn, formerly 
in the Governor's office, and recently appointed Chair of the Electricity 
Oversight Board, would be the hands-down best candidate.

Best,
Jeff

If any of you have ideas on this, please respond ASAP.  As you may know, I 
sit on the CSU Foundation Board of Governors, accountable to Chancellor 
Reed.  Anything we can do to support the upcoming meeting will go a long way.

Regards, Tom
