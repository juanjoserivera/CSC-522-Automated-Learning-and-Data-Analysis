Ina,

Thanks for checking into it.  Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.  If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?  Maybe it was used at one time or another, but just got forgotten.  Anyway, it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building.

Thanks.

Mat
