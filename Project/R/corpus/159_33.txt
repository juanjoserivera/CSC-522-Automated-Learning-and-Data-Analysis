GT,  I will be taking Friday off.  Probably drive in Friday morning or early 
afternoon.  What are your plans that day?  If you need any help setting up or 
anything let me know.

g,

The boat leaves at 6:00 pm from Carlos and Charlies. It would help if you
took a  day of vacation. We are going to have a blast. Check at work and let
me know what your plans are.
