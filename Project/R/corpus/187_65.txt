I was very worried last night.  David's note made it seem like something had happened.  I didn't know my phone was out.  I hardly use it...i'm really not a phone person.  But when I realized it was out yesterday...cingular was closed and i couldn't call.  John is getting in today.  I am doing a fun run tomorrow morning and we will be in the rest of the weekend.  I should get the phone taken care of later this afternoon.  This evening I have another broker dinner.  I will try to call before I got to that.   Talk to you later.
