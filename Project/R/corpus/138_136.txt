Thanks.  I got Jim's and Eric's right after lunch.  Jim was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  Eric seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.

Tom
