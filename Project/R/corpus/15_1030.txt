Subject: Dec99 Enron North America Wholesale Volumes

The database for December & 4Q99's wholesale volumes is now ready for 
viewing.  Just as a reminder, this is the shortcut on your desktop called 
"Statistical Database".  If you experience any difficulties, please contact 
me.  

With increased investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor Relations 
has requested that they be provided with monthly volumetric analysis for 
Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly analysis being currently 
provided.  As part of the request, Business Analysis & Reporting has been 
asked to provide comparisons with explanations to prior year,s monthly and 
quarterly volumes.

In light of the increased investor awareness, please review the attached 
analysis for December & 4Q1999 and provide explanations for all material 
changes(+/- 10%).  The current objective of Investor Relations is to use this 
analysis as a resource to answer potential investor or analyst questions, but 
it may be used for ad hoc requests and presentations.   It is essential that 
the volumes be verified by commercial personnel prior to distribution to 
Investor Relations.

Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail no later than 
3:00 pm on Wednesday, January 12th.  Please feel free to call with any 
questions.
