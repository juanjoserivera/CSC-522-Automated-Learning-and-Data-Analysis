Tim,

We definitely appreciate any time that Steve is able to spare.  If you like, I will ask Mat coordinate his travel plans with Steve.  Also, if Steve made his rework documentation available, Mat would become familiar with it prior to his trip.

Keith,

The hitch here is that our demand expert, Steve Swain, is currently on emergency loan to the EES rehabilitation effort, and he's got a pretty tight schedule. I just talked to Steve, though, and he's willing to spend a day or two if we can accomodate his schedule. Also, he's put together some documentation on last year's major rework of the model that will probably make the time available sufficient to get a good understanding of what we're doing.
