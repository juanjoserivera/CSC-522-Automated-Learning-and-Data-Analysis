We can try.  The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company but I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal.  I will get back to you.
