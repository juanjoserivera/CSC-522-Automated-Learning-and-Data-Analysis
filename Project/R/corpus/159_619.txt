Ryan,  If you keep sending emails to her every 30 minutes, she will 
eventually respond.  I am on to your twisted little games.

Eric,

Kristi needs your email address.  I don't know if you wanted to give here
your home or work so I'll leave it up to you to do (see note below).

Gerald,

I guess it looks like Kristi likes me best, but we knew that now didn't we.
