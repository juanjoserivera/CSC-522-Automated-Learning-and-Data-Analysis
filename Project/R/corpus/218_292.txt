Kate,
	Returned your call, but your phone would not put me through to voice mail. Any help you can give Pam would be quite beneficial and appreciated by both her and I. She is getting zero help down here and that is why I pointed her you your direction. I have not dug down in the process, but is seems to be way to  manual for all parties involved. I just want the process improved so that it takes some of the manual error work out the flow. Give me a call at 713-345-6120 if you need anything.

								Thanks
								 Chris
