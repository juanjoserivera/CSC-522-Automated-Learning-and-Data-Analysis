I've been working pretty heavily. This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runs
for about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of Houston.
It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves,
swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really into
it, and travel a long way to go.
Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird? Go online if you haven't, and have the big guy look
at it, too. I think it looks pretty awesome, but I'm not sure it will be my next car.

Love,
Jason
