Jeff:
While I don't quite follow how terminating the Fixed taints the Floating 
since we have separated the 2, I am okay with this if this is how our 
commercial people understand how it works.

Thanks for your comments.  A new draft should be out shortly that addresses
your comments.  Re the deleted language in 3.4, it is considered essential
that nothing can happen to terminate the Fixed Payment side of the Swap
since this could arguably taint the Floating Payment obligations.  The
investors are very sensative to this concern and I'm not sure we care.  Let
me know if you disagree.
