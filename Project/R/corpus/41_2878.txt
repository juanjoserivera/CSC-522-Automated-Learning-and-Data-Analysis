Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Best,
Jeff
