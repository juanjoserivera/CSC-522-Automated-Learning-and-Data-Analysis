Hey you back!
 
I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.  Don't take it for anything other than I was very busy.  I have no problem being friends and even getting together, whenever.
Right now I'm in a position in my life where I just want to do what I want to do, I know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how I feel.  I think after you get through with all the BS that's going on in your life you will understand where I'm coming from.  So for now don't take anything I do personally, and feel free to call whenever you want.  And, yes I wuld like to get together.....
 
Paul
And you too have a great day!!!
