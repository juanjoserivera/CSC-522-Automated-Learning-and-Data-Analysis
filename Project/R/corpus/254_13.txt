Happy Thanksgiving to you too.  Things at Enron don't look promising for anyone right now, but we'll see what happens.  The stock just keeps dropping and we have more debt around the corner.  Jo and I are going to mom's on Thursday, then we are going to visit her grandparents over the weekend.  We are not going to the game, but we will be watching it on TV.  It doesn't look good for A&M because we got some key guys that are injured, hopefully we can make it a close game.  Have a safe trip and say hi to mimi for me. Talk to you soon. - Jason
