I am not in a huge hurry. I just want to make sure we have fully reviewed our options now that we have a little more time. LLGM should participate on this call and gather all other information available(Mirant and Reliant legal memos) and lets talk sometime next week. I think LLGM is in a better position than Enron to dictate timing, so I'll leave the scheduling to you.
