Spoke with Chance on friday, he believes that the wholesale data is clean. I also sent an email to Chance, Pat and Scott that raised the issue of PV'ed positions. I am waiting for a response. 
 
I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts. I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas. Any questions give me a shout.
Joe
