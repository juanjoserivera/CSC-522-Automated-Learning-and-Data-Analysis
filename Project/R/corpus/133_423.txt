This time table of 6 p.m. is not acceptable for risk management.  Most days we are not done calcing the gas books by 6 p.m.  Now we have just learned that Oracle is down and we do not know when we will get to start the calcing process that we normally start at 3:30.  Please adjust accordingly.  Thanks.
