Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since:

a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential
creditor action against Enron.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.

b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be 
done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the 
US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new Enron deal) are there.

c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at
4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.

d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this
category, but not like a mortgage.


Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run.
