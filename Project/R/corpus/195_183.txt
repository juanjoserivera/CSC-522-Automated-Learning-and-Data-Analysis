I've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.  We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.  Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back Emily Party"?  If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.  Hope the paper(s) is/are going well.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

PS - I'm in Seattle this weekend, so I'll miss the friend.
