Jim,
 
I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am waiting for his response.
In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.
Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?
Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.
 
Monika
