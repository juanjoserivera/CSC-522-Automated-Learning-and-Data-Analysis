Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?
