Dear Mrs. Kemp,

My name is Jonathan McKay and the reason I am contacting you is with respect to obtaining sponsorship to become member of the local CFA society. I moved from Calgary, Canada in September and I am not familiar with anyone that belongs to the Houston chapter. I obtained your name from the AIMR website and would appreciate any help you could offer me as far as sponsorship or putting me in contact with some of the local members.  I have completed the third level exam and need this sponsorship in order to obtain my designation.  I can be contacted at (h) 713 225 -1230, (w) 713 853 - 4810, or via email at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.

Thank you,

Jon McKay
