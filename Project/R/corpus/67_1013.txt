The way I understand the suggestion, we will always be able to change a slate 
if we need to.  This puts more of the responsibility on us to keep the names 
updated if any changes need to be made.  I guess I have no problem with that 
as long as we can develop a systematic way of handling this and then be 
disciplined about following that system.  Bill--I suspect you will end up 
being our "system" so are you up to it?

Subject: FW: Revisiting Annual Elections for Domestic Entities


Review the message below from the Corp., Sec., office, and let me know if you 
have any disagreement over their intention to alter the annual election 
process.  (I for one do not see any problem with this, since we make changes 
on a regular basis.)  

Bill
