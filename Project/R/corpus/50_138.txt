Yes, I set it up with Ken & Dan.  We had a good discussion.  I'm going up for the weekly Imbalance meeting today to discuss some things with Darrell and Richard (Dan will be there).  Tracy & I are also meeting with Dan & John on Thursday to try to "diagram" some of the accounting process with imbalances, linepack & fuel (LOOK OUT!).  When we get the explanation organized, we will be presenting it to all y'all =)

I hope you had a nice weekend in San Antonio.  I know the weather was wonderful.  Hope Hershal is doing better.

Take Care,
Lindy
