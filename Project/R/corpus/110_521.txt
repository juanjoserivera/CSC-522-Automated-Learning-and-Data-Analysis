Brian,

It sounds great. I know from personal experience that it's much better to develop
a new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expectations.
If you don't manage the management, they will give you zero credit
for the idea, and a lot of grief for slow deployment.

I see the usefulness of this technology in many places where we trade power.

Is it OK to consult one my associates (Martin Lin) and  ask him for his
opinion? He knows infinitely more about transmission than I do.

A lunch / dinner at a Sardinian restaurant would be great.
I spent a summer in Sardinia in 1970.
