No problem!  In fact, it is likely I'll be in NY wed-sat next week--I'm sure 
I'll stop by the gallery.  Hope to see you...

Subject: RE: Ben Macklowe's Birthday Party


Sorry to hear that you won't be joining us. I will be sure to let Ben know
that you wanted to attend.  Please do me a favor - an obvious favor but one
that I will feel remiss if I do not ask...Please do not send him something
before tomorrow night as it is still a surprise. I only ask because you
mentioned that you would try to send him something tomorrow.  His actual
birthday is on the 22nd so he still has no idea.
Thank you and perhaps we can all get together on your next trip to NY.
Be well and have a happy holiday season.
Hillary
