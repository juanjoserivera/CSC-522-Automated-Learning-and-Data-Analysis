Mr. Keffer,

Asking this crowd to vote was like throwing chum to sharks.

The problem is that the two pictures are so dramatically different from each 
other and present two completely different views of Mr. Keffer.   #1 looks 
very respectable, likeable, and professional, whereas #2 looks  very 
professional, likeable, and respectable.   Real hard call, but I think you go 
with #1. 

Besides, the exposure and contrast on #1  looks better - its darker. I have 
seen paper city photo (was that a swimsuit?), but urge you to avoid any 
pictures in a tank with a tankers helmet on.

Carlos, you have much  wisdom for such a young buckeroo.

If Debbie can't decide and if you can't use the PaperCity photo (it realy is 
a good pic), I'd go with the first one.  I must say that all of them look 
pretty, well, serious.  Kinda Gore-like, you know.  

Ok, that was a low blow.  I was just kidding!!

I would opt for the photo that you had in your Paper City article about you 
being the commentator at the polo matches as that photo conveyed a more 
rugged and stylish image.  I see these pictures and think -- "Al Gore, no 
George Bush, no Al Gore, no George Bush, well I can't make up mind, is there 
a Ralph Nader picture that I can choose from?"  All that being said, if they 
were my pictures, I'd let my wife decide, otherwise, I'd be subject to an 
eternity of second-guessing.
