When operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point
or group comment section in CAS.

*During normal business hours except for Evening and ID-2, Myself, Gary, Steve, Terry, or John should be 
 responsible for loading comments into CAS unless the Reps. have been given the directive to update comments.
*Weekends, and Holidays, Reps. will be loading comments into CAS.
*When new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated, you will need
 to page me or in my absence Gary, Steve.  We will let you know what to do with the capacity either update
 or allocate.  
If you have any questions please call me or page.
