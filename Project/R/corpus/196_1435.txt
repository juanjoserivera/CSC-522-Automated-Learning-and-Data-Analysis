                  Did you know?
                  You may know today's word as a generalized term for anything
                  unusual, but "weird" also has older meanings that are more
                  specific. "Weird" derives from the Old English noun "wyrd,"
                  essentially meaning "fate." By the late 8th century, the 
plural
                  "wyrde" had begun to appear in texts as a gloss for 
"Parcae,"
                  the Latin name for the Fates -- three goddesses who spun,
                  measured, and cut the thread of life. In the 15th and 16th
                  centuries, Scots authors employed "werd" or "weird" in the
                  phrase "weird sisters" to refer to the Fates. William
                  Shakespeare adopted this usage in Macbeth, in which the
                  "weird sisters" are depicted as three witches. Subsequent
                  adjectival use of "weird" grew out of a reinterpretation of 
the
                  "weird" in Shakespeare.
