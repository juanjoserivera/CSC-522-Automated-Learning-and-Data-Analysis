Michael,

I really appreciate it. It will be a great opportunity to give you
an update about my plans. I hope to continue working
in the energy industry and continue as a customer of CERA once
I move to a new position. My last day at Enron will be January the 31st.
My personal E-mail address in the interim period is vkaminski@aol.com.

I assume I can just show up on the first day of your conference.


Vince
