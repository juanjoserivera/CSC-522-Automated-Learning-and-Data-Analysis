Congratulations!  Enron will most likely file Ch 11.  Either today or tomorrow.  It's pretty crazy.  I really don't know what the future holds.  I will just have to wait and see.  We definitely want to go skiing.  Most likely in the spring.  I may have to wait and see how this thing plays out though.  I am going to Dallas on Saturday and we may stay at your sisters place.  They sure kicked the shit out of the Huskers.  I'll keep in touch.
