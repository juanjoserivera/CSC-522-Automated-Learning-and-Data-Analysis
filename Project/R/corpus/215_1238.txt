Charles --

After our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider --

1.	How does NERC define "security"? (important to differentiate between national security and system security).
2.	What is NERC's role in national security?
3.	Will RTOs degrade national security?  system security?
4.	What does Enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?
5.	Does Enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?

This Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.

Thanks.
