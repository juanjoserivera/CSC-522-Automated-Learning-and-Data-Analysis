I'm up on all that. I was on my way to Portland, so couldn't pick up Canidate. However, it looks
like Faulk only has bruised bone and will be back in 1-2 weeks.
Shaun Alexander was the big miss, that guy could be a stud.
We won again, and are 4th in the league with a good shot to win our next 2.
Surprising, considering how shitty Thrash has become. 

I will be back from Portland Wed night so I will probably see you at some point.
