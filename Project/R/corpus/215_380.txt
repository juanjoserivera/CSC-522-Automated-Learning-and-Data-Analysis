We need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any RTO - unless and until I hear something different from FERC, my going in assumption is that Enron will be one of the only voices on this issue.  We should only give on this issue when real value is being created. 

Why not file a "me too" on the issue of seating of the Board w/o agreeing to everything else?
