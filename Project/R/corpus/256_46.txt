I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get mad, I could put
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like enough of a princess to
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway of however many
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would really show how much
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me.
We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full.
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.

Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we go.
And I think of you as my partner every day, and I'm sorry I take it for granted.
