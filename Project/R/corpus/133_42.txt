What????  I thought that was your team?  I am a big raiders fan and I hope Chucky gets that ring this year.  Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested - March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the three nights.  I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if you are interested.  Take care.
