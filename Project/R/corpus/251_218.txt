I don't have a problem with it.  I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the "kids" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.  At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.  Especially if Steve wants to "pick his brains".
