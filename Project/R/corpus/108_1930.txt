Please call Carol.  How about the Buffalo Grille, or is that too busy?

Good!!  If you want to get Hollie, Lucinda, etc., to come, please feel free
to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go???

I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will return
it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it
fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to
come by anyway to see what else you have done to it.

I will call Carol, too, if you don't care.
