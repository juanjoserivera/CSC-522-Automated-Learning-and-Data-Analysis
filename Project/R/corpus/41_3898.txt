You know what is more recently?  Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San Diego (they said).  So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.  Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.  Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.  I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss. In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?  Might be a good idea to keep doing that.  

Best,
Jeff
