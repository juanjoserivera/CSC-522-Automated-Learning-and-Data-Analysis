Thanks.  Steve has been a valuable asset for Enron and ETS which is exactly why other Enron business units are so interested in his services.  I made sure that Steve knew that he could stay with ETS.  The decision was his.  However, we must always remember that sometimes we need do what is in the best interest of Enron and not just ourselves.  Thank you for letting me know your feelings.
