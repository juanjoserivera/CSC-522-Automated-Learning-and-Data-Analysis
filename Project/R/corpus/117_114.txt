Hey,

Phillip already made reservations and Jeff is waiting to make sure he can go.  Darren and his wife have made their plans, and Dawn and Gary have also, I think.  I will next week, and a couple other girls from risk are going too.  We're leaving on the 13th, returning the 16th.  Staying at the Mirage. 

You could win thousands in Vegas to use for your house.  What other vacation can do that.

Well, we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for now.  I'm sure it will be next week though.  We're assuming it will happen and have been setting up all new files and databases.  It should be interesting.

How is your job?  Does Kyle Lilly work for you now?

Later,
Kam
