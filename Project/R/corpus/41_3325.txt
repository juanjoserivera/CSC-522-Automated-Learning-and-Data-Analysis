One other thing.  I just had coffee with a former business colleague.  She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).  I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t. setting up board, staff, etc.  She's very interested. She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.  Are you interested in talking to her?

Best,
Jeff
