Shit--I knew I forgot something!  My boss leaves for good on April one, so I'll be spending 3 or so days a wk in Hou starting now.  I'll be the VP and General Counsel of Enron Transportation Services, which is the division that runs all the pipelines.  Yeeha.  I agree about getting together--when you coming down to visit the sister in law?  Maybe we can run up to MPLS for a boondoggle.  Also, I'll be in DC the 22d and 23d of March--where are you?  DF

Congratulations! 

What is the job, anyway.  Or have you failed to even ask? 

When do you go?  We need to plan a get together.
