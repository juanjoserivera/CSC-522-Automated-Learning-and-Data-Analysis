Hey what is going on?  I haven't talked to you in a few days and I feel lost.  First day at work in a while.  It feels weird.  I miss you very much.  I hope you have had a wonderful holiday season.  Mine has been okay.  Very long.  Not as good as it could have been.  I think about you every second of the day.  I am sorry I haven't called but the times I did call and I only had a limited amount of time, it didn't end good and I didn't want that to happen.  I want you to know that out of sight does not mean out of mind.  You are always on my mind.  I can't get by without thinking of you.  I have thought alot about my situation over the last couple of weeks.  I don't know how I am going to manage it but I need to make a change for myself.  I feel like I am in some sort of prison.  I need more freedom, I need more love, I need more affection, I need more life.  You probably try not to think about us because of the situation, I understand that, but I hope I haven't left your mind completely.  You are so special, so beautiful, wonderful, fun and I haven't even got to know you that well yet.  Have a wonderful New Year and please be careful.  Think about me.  I cherish the day I can see you again.  

John
