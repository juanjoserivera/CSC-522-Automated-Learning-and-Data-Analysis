Bobby, 

Unfortunately, we will not be able to make it Saturday night.  We will be in Dallas visiting my brother and his wife, sort of a late Christmas get together.  I hate that we are going to miss it, but I will touch base with you later.

Also, please change the e-mail addresses you have for me and Tonya to:  dfarmer70@houston.rr.com and tjfarmer@houston.rr.com


Thanks.

Daren
