Have to agree with your assessment.  And, I promise she will try like the dickens to do stuff with Niklaus (sp?) maybe at the expense of doing things with you.  Mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.  He came over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.  Me in a wing-back and Lisa and Mitch holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.  This is the second time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had to witness the "cuddle fest."  Not to mention the "cuddle fest" we all witnessed with Chad at Europa.  Maybe if she does come over you could be the little red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force her to make some sort of decision about all these guys.  She's in heat right now I swear.  Every 5 sec. there's some new guy she thinks is hot.  The guy serving us at Jason's Deli might be the next victim.  She's totally out of control.  I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik probably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.  It's really pitiful you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.  Did I mention that Laura White's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Mitch and I at Kenneally's b/c I was spending more time with him than Lisa (she was of course performing the role of social butterfly).  Like I said, it's pitiful.  In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her "friends" that have met Mitch and think he's all right  I'm pretty sure everyone else has told her they think she can do better.  I beg to differ, knowing Lisa a little better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually but not perceived (at least by her) as a complete push-over.  Perfect combo for our Ms. Gillette.

Can you believe my parents?  They were only in San Diego for all of 12 hrs and took a roll of film...what dorks.

I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me.

KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER!  com'on.....realllly!  one
would think this email was to organize a trip to london- but nooooo...it's a
"hands off" warning instead.  and admittedly, the bit about "trusting me to
honor" pulls at me and w/ anyone else, i'd snap into good behavior mode, but
then i step bk and realize how sneaky and evil (hel-lo?  who is mitch?  does
she have dibs on him as well?  how many 'dibs' are we allocated?  let me
know when you get the scoop...)what nerve!  as for the 1 line about coming
to london, katy isn't coming mid may- she's coming at the end-begin. of
june, which is much better for me, too- have school full-time til last week
of may....so, i vote you send her mid may, then come w/ kates at the end of
the month.  and, gee- do tyou think i can predict her visit?  let's see-
it'll be convenient and cheap to stay w/ me....but- perfect timing for her
to show up at my doorstep, get her extra key, then jaunt off to 'secure' her
position w/ mr.dibs....not that i'm complaining- just horribly offended that
she thinks i'm so dense as to not be able to see- and hear- her large, slow,
unoiled wheels a-turning....!  aughhhhh!  see below, obviously....
