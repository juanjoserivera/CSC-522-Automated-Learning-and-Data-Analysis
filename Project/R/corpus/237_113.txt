Where were you flying to?  

I turned 39 yesterday... that sucks....

Kim has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.  

What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?  

Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

best regards,

BT
