they did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset.  the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire.  skilling and fastow bolted.  i have no respect for them.  i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 89, but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 80 and we are taken over at 110.  not 90 down to 10.
