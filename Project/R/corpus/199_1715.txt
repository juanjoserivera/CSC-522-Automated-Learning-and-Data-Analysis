Tanya:

If you check Lotus Notes, you'll see an entry by Shari Stack (waiting for 
Credit).  I checked my list of requested Enron Corp. ISDA's (see my email to 
you of 10/26/00) and I don't see anything.  I don't know where the internal 
request came from.  Should we check with Treasury?

Do you know about this? Sounds like maybe we want to duplicate the ENA ISDA 
to Corp.
