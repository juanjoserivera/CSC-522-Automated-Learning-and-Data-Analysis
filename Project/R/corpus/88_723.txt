It would definitely be out of your way.  I don't mind driving downtown, so why don't we just meet at the Wortham at about 7?.  We have been parking in one of the outside lots off Smith right across from the side of the Wortham (the Bank One Lot) since the flood closed down so many of the underground garages.
