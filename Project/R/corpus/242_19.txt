I have responded to PurEnergy to supply gas to two of their power plants located in southern california.  We are going to propose a gas daily option with a demand charge.  The contact for credit is Ms. Suzette Brower @ 315-448-2266 and her email is sbrower@purenergyllc.com.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

thanks

Kim
