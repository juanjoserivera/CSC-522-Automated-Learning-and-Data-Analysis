Kendal:
I need to push back our call 30 minutes.  Does 10:30 your time still work?

Carol,
Thank you so much for sending me an e-mail!  My traders are pushing hard to
get an agreement in place with Enron.
I have some time tomorrow morning around 10AM Eastern Time.  Would you be
available at that time to discuss?
Thanks,
