Good morning Chris.  Further to our conversation of yesterday.  

I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group. We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team. You will be asked to provide real time modeling, DCF, research on wellhead to burner tip strategies. You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip. Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.  

Please use this note as a formal offer of employment. I would like you to start as soon as you can.. ( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday. 

Pls contact me directly if there are any questions regarding this note or any other matters. 

regards, Barry Tycholiz
