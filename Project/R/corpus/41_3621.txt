I would have been happy to let you have it.  You still can, you know.  Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it another time.  And what about those 9-ers?
