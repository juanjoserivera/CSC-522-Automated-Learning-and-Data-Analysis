I'll check on reviving the unbundling, but I think they've begged off of that for now.  In their most recent BCAP, they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone.  You have that proposal?  And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.  I can check on that.
 
Best,
