Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from Enron Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until today.  I tried to open the attachment - our network operations require that the file be saved first before opening.  Did that, and what comes up looks like it is in tongues!!!  Unfortunately, I can't read anything, but hopefully Nancy was able to review it.  

I realized today that the article that Lori Ewalt gave me in hard copy at the board meeting is still in my NCL folder.  I meant to retype and get this to you in a word attachment, but frankly the hours at Enron have been horrific.  I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM last Tuesday.  Unless Lori got that article to you in another way, we are missing that from the newsletter!  

I will call you and if indeed Lori's article is not in there (not the permission form, but another article), I will contact Sally and I will simply make copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing.  Sorry about this!!  

Sounds as if you had a busy Thanksgiving on top of a move as well.  Hope that you are enjoying the new place.  Too bad about the Sooners on Saturday.  David had thought about driving to Dallas next weekend for the Big 12 Championship game, but obviously won't be doing that now!  --Sally
