Sorry to hear that.  I hope everything goes well at work.  My company is crumbling.  It's pretty scary.  A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.  I ended up getting a cable modem.  I really didn't want to do that because I absolutely hate Time Warner.  And what do you know, they screwed up my first bill.
