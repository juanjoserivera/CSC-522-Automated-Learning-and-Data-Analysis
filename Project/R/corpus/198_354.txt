Dear Neil,

Sorry you two missed each other last night.  How would 10:30 a.m. on 
Wednesday, December 13 work for you and Paul?  I have pencilled it on Jeff's 
calendar at that time.  I'll hold it until I hear otherwise.  Thank you.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Thanks for the reply Sherri.  I missed Jeff last night at Paul's so we
didn't get a chance to talk.  Paul and I would appreciate the opportunity to
set up a meeting before the holidays.  I know it's going to be tough given
everyone's tight schedules, but please find below some dates that work for
Paul and me:

Dec 11 afternoon; Dec 12 afternoon; Dec 13 10:30-2:00; Dec 15 afternoon; Dec
18/19/21 all day

Please let me know if any of these dates work so we can set a firm time.  If
Jeff wants to combine with lunch, that would be great too.  Thanks/Neil.
