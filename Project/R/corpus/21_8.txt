I am fine with this schedule.  I am a little concerned about Lynda testing because
of Galen being out and the team shortage.  Should we have a back up to Lynda
if she cannot get away from the day to day so we do not loose any time on the
testing.  Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn and John
Just to let you know, I have spoke to both Kathy and Lynda regarding the upcoming testing. They have both agreed to assist when their schedules permited. I explained this to Ramona and she said that would be Ok at this point and time. They may require more assistance as this is a large project and needs to go into production on the 15th of July. Please let me know if you are OK with this. Thank you.
