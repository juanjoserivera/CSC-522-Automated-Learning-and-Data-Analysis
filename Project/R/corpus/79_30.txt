Hey sugar, I am still at work, just waiting on the IT people to set up a new folder in the UBS directory so that I can move all my files over.  Once that is done I will be leaving.  I will probably go directly to the Container Store.  Just let me know if that is okay.  

Are you getting hungry?  Do you want me to bring something?  Or do you want to eat at home.

Love you

The Pigs
