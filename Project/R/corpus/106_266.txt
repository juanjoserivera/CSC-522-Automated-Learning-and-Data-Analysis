I thought that we were each faxing our signature pages.  I sent Enron's 
earlier, however, I have yet to receive any signature pages from the other 
entities.  Please fax to Dan Hyvl at (713) 646-3490.

BP's fax number is (403) 233-5655

Just to clarify, are we all putting the documents together for ourselves and
faxing execution pages with originals to follow?  Or am I to wait to receive
an original before executing and faxing?
