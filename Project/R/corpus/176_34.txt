I would guess that Paul will lose his job within the next few weeks...but that should not leave the walls of your house.  I think I am ok if I want to stay.  It is really a scary situation and this is what I get for corporate lifestyle I guess.  We probably won't know the full effects for several more months, but I think that a lot of people will get laid off before Christmas.

Gald to hear that Mom and Dad made it ok.  Hope y'all are having fun together.  

How are you feeling?  I have not talked to you since your wonderful phone call.  I heard you were going through some pretty bad morning sickness but that things were better now.  I am praying that from here on out you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Really try to enjoy it.  Let me know how you are doing and what you need or need for the baby.  However, I am not available to go pick up ice cream and a pickle at 2am, that is W.R.'s job.  I have already done that.

Take care and I will try to keep you posted.

Love,
Jay
