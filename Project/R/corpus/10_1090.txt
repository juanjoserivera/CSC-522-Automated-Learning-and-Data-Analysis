Hey:
That's one hell of a bd celebration.  Don't think I can hang in you guys.  
Was definitely a little sleepy yesterday.  Went to the bb game and then had a biz dinner last night.  I was almost asleep driving home at 8:30.  At least I was sane enough to yell buy and sell at random points during the day.
