I understand the control concern but it sure would allow us to be more efficient since Texas is small and clean (probably not a full time manager job).  He has not and will not be taking risk positions (at least not initially) he has been and will be trading our daily Waha phyical volumes.  If he evolved to a point where we wanted him to take risk positions we then could move him out of Risk.  What do you think?

If you don't think this will work let me know, but in that scenario I guess I would say don't count on Dave.  I guess I will have to move him into the Associate program or Logistics.  I we go down that road then I feel like I need to run this by Dave since he effectively will be cutting his ties to Risk and taking some career risk.  I am sure if it does not work out you or some other company would welcome Dave in a risk role.  Let me know what you think or just call me and we can get together.
