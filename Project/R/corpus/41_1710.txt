Ah Jeez:
Hey Joseph, I was supposed to trade a name with Deepikah and, wouldn't you 
know, with all the fine print, I grabbed one of yours (bet you're sorry you 
asked me to help out now).  Anywho, I called and left a message with Tim 
Taylor.  You call him yet?  If so, he'll think he's very special, what with 
all of us calling him.  Let me know.

Deepikah, I called Lisa Ralphe off of your list.

Yours in flake-dom,
Jeff

Hi Jeff-
Howz it going?  Long time no see - we need to do a happy hour so that we can
catch up!  Hope you had a blast at the Resort at Squaw of couple of weekends
ago.  Wasn't it a gorgeous weekend!  

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list
of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question
around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a
similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. 

If you have already called him, don't worry about it.  If not, go ahead and
we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish.  Just let me know
who you pick on my list!

Take care,
Deepika
