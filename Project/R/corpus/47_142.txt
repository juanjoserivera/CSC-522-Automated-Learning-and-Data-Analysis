Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with respect to the month in which the institute is held?  If it is to be held in February, I would opt to try Houston, New Orleans, or Santa Fe. I suggest that, if possible, we avoid scheduling the conference on Valentines Day or any holiday.  All the best.  Jim Derrick
