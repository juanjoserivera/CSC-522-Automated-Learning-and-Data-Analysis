I was not aware that the market closed at 1:00 on Friday 11/23.  Funny we did not discuss this when we talked on the phone on Wednesday.  How does this impact the bigger issue that needs to be resolved?  Let me know when you get the answer on the rest of the matter.  Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
