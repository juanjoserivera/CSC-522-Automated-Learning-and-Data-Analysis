Roman,

I shall be traveling next week (Europe again), Mon thru Fri.
It's Power 2000 conference in Paris.

I have many trips to different places later during October
(Berkeley, Philadelphia, etc.). These are shorter, 1-2
day trips. Please, let me know when you come to Houston.
I shall keep you posted about my itinerary as 
it becomes more certain.

Vince
