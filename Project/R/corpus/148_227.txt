I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.

Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.

Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.

Thanks,

Errol
