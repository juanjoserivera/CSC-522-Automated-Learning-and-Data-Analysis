John:
I received the form of Guaranty by fax and it looks fine.  After you have 
filled in the blanks, please fax it either to me or Susan and in the mean 
time Susan will be sending you execution sets of the docs.

Carol -

Two things:

* First, I will try to email this guaranty to you again, followed with
a fax.  Apparently both failed to go through yesterday.
* Second, I did some research and it turns out that our general
partner is El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company, and Cecelia Heilmann is an
officer authorized to sign for both this entity and the L.P..  So if you
want to alter the signature block reflecting this general partner, feel free
to do so.

Please let me know later this morning if you still did not get our Guaranty.


John
