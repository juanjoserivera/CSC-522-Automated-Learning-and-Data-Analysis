I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.  I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha
