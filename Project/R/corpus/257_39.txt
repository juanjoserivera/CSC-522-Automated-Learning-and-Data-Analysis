Edan,

Thanks!!!! I didn't realize that you were still in Hong Kong. How's life??? Are you married? I can't remember. 

Married life is good. Different but good.

Paul

Long time no speak!  Heard about your good news - congrats on your wedding.  I
am very happy for you.

Drop me a note some time to let me know you have received this.

Best,
Edan Lee
