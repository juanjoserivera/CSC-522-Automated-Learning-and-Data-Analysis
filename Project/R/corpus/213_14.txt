Amy,
I just now opened my e-mail (7:30)  - I've been trying to figure out where you were because I saw the capacity reports and the Gas Daily.  I thought you left to go get breakfast.  DARN!.
 
I hope you feel better.   I wouldn't worry about coming in today.  Ty needs to work on our model before we could start anything anyway.
 
See you tomorrow.
 
Theresa
