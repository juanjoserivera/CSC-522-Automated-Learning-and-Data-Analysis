Peter, Eric.... I talked to Bradford this a.m. regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for PG&E. He said he would review Post Petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to PG&E. He was going to discuss internally and advise.

I am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds, so this may conflict with the timelines Eric and I discussed this a.m.
