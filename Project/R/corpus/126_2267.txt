i just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office.  i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career.  although this year has been up and down, i am enjoying my role on the desk.  i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up.  the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver.  we can talk more about it if you would like on monday.
