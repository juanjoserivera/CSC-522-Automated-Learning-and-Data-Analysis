No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

No word yet-
Raul and John Batten are here today trying to sell our services to the new
administration - so we should hopefully know soon...  Did you go skiing?
