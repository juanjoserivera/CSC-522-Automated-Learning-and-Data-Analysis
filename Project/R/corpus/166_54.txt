Constance,

I was on vacation from October 4th to October 19th and I didn't submit my timesheet yet. I tried to do it on the HRonline web-site, but the procedure is too complicated.
Is it possible that you or somebody else in the HR department mark the vacation time?
I would really appreciate that.

Thank you.
