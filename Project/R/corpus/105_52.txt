Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.

Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  

Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.

If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.
