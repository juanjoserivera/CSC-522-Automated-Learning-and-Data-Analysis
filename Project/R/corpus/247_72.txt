Tom,

i really do understand your concern, and i will try to expedite this process as much as possible.  i'm sorry that all of this wasn't worked out prior to signing the merger, but we put it together rather quickly.  we have built an incredible energy franchise here and neither of us, Enron or Dynegy, wants it to falter.  i will get you as much information as i can, as soon as i can.  i would be happy to hear any ideas that you have on providing more stability sooner.

thanks for sending the note, and i apologize for the uncertainty.

greg
