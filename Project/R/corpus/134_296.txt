I am not officializing 1091026 because we ran two basis calcs for the last 
day and we officialized the other one and it has the same value - that post 
id is 1091034.  Also, FT-Ontario's book admin is now Patrick Ryder, Market 
Mich is Jad Doan and FT Intra Ontario is Chuck Ames.  Please shout with 
anymore questions.  Thanks.
