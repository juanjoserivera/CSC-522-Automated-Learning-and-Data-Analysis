Hello Jonda,

I know your getting ready to go on vacation and I just wanted you to know that I called the credit card companies and had them mail me my YTD statements.  They would not fax it.  So, I would just attach a letter saying were waiting on the companies or leave it blank (N/A).

Anyway, she sent me another e-mail and I have not replied to any of them just to let you and Mr. Fulenweider know.  Have a great vacation..you deserve it!!

-Joe
