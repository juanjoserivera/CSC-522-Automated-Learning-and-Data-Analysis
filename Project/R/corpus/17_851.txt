What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally
