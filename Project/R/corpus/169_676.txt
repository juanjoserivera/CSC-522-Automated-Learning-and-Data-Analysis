Calpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their company hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts.   Calpine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-CA locations.
 
Given these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particulary with the legal concerns they also have.   I would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at Dighton, particularly with the legal issues.
