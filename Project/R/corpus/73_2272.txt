3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell him.  This was an ENA deal.
