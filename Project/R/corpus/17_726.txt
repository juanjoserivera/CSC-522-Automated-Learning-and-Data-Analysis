I know that the timing on choosing these interns was short.  Thanks for responding back to Jana so quickly.  And now most of them will be here next Monday!  Please be certain that you and your assistant are actively working on a location, phone and computer (with necessary access granted) for these interns.  I want to be certain that all interns have a very positive introduction to working at Enron.  

This list excludes those that will assigned to EGM under Brent Price and his team.  As soon as I get an updated list from Jana, I will schedule a meeting for this week so that we can discuss how we will make the internships a success this summer.  All ideas will be welcome, so get creative before coming to the meeting.  Thanks.  --Sally
