I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.  

I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.

Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines?
