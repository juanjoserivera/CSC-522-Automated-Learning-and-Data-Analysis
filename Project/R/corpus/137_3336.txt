Chris,

Your invoice for December reflects final revisions to the documents through 
December 20th, so I'm assuming the draft the Schaeffer's signed was done 
subsequent to anything transmitted on December 13th.   However, emailing 
documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help.

Thanks for your response,

Kay

Kay -- 

I understand that we have received your revisions to the Schaffer Option
Agreement and are in the process of incorporating them into the document.
We will then contact the Schaffers' attorneys and get the changes
incorporated.

We apologize for the confusion regarding the last set of revisions.  Those
revisions arose following our teleconference with the Schaffers' attorneys.
Apparently, Don was acting under the assumption that you were tied up on
other matters and had coordinated with Stuart, Fred and Rusty.
Nevertheless, you should be able to find a copy in your electronic file
attached to a December 13, 2000 email from Fred.  Although Don had
subsequent conversations with Rusty and Stuart, we should have circled back
with you.

In the future, we will ensure that you receive email copies of all of the
documents, with the changes highlighted as you requested.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this matter
further. 

Thank you.
