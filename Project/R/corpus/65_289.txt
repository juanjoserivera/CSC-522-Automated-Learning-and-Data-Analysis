A lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.
No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.
You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed.
Thanks,
