I have put the staff meeting referenced at the bottom of John's message on my calendar.  Please check with Kim on the location and as to whether or not future dates are set.  Also, please check to see if date for offsite has been set.  We are trying to schedule a vacation, and it would help to know the dates of the offsite.  Thanks.
