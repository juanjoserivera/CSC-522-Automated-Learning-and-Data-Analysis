Did you look at it on the website?  It looks like fun.  Michael and I could 
probably have fun on the quiet water days.  I'll need a ladder, so I'll have 
to break the news to Pop Pop.

Pretty cool!
So do you want a kayak for Spring Break next week? You will need a roof
rack. I'm sure REI has what we need. NM
