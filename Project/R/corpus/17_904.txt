John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunately occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handled during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know that everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we have to stay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of your team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that could or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify, it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's performance is impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Unify.  Thanks.  --Sally
