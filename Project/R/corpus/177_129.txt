hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every day.  

let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in.    

i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small town!  

hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?
