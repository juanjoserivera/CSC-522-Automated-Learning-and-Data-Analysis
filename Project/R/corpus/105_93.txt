see what happens when you leave the gas bidness homey?  Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.  They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.  Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.
