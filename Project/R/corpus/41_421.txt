Boy would I like to come to Houston.  But looks like I'll be stuck here, at 
least this week.  Soon as I get to Houston, I'll look you up and we can 
compare notes.
Best,
Jeff

That is always a good sign.  Again, if you come to Houston I would love to 
meet with you and discuss synergies of reporting on this issue.  Are you guys 
looking into the DWR's announcement that was postponed yesterday regarding 
revenue rates/rate hikes?
