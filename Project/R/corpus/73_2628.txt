Thanks for writing buddy.  Things are going very well on the home front.  Things began to improve after you and I had our little chat before Christmas and they have been improving ever since.  I really do appreciate it.
 
How's work at Enron?  Good question.  I started taking my vacation on the 27th.  I'm scheduled to be out until the 14th to use up all of my 2001 vacation.  I honestly believe some of us will be let go this week or next week.  But then its anybodys guess these days too.  I do check my emails from home and thats when I got your message.  There isn't anything to do at work right now.  I guess we should hear something this week.
 
How are things going with you?
