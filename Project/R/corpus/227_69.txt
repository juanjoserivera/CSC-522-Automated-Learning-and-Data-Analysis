I spoke with Joe Collins (see below) this morning.  They are definitely thinking about the Commodity Exchange Act implications.  They don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the CEA pitfalls -- maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the CFTC.  I gave him your name as someone he might hear from in the future concerning the transaction.
