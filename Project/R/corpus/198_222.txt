Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but 
will return tomorrow morning.  

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.  
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of 
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the 
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to 
free up some time.  Thank you.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Subject: RE: Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock


Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?
Erica
