Hi,

I did make the cut and I'm one of the three, in fact I've got to stay around for a certain period of time before Enron will let me go.  I think I'll stay put through the holidays and then see what happens during the first part of January.  I hope your flight went well!  It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday and cold and snowy on Saturday.  Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.

Paul
