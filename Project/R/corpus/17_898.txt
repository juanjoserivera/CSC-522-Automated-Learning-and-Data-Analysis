My hot buttons for operations  would be recruiting, career development and resource planning.  Before I simply make assignments, let me canvas my direct reports to be certain that we are assigning those with passion around these areas.  My staff meeting will be tomorrow at 9:00.  I will get back with you on volunteers and also to either reaffirm or alter the hot buttons that I mentioned.  --Sally
