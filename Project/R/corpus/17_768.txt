Got your note.  I am not incredibly attached to Commercial Support and I agree that overall it probably sounds second class.   Professional Services sounds fine to me.  I have forwarded your message to a handful of my direct reports to get their comments - Bob Hall, Brent Price, Beth Apollo and Peggy Hedstrom.  I should hear back from them today, and I will pass along any pertinent comments.  Thanks.  --Sally
