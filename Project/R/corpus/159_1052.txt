Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail 
our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the letter 
such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event that 
Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, 
we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages.  
Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it 
there.

From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our 
protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause 
problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing 
to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.

Joan, Gerald:
I am wondering whether we need to send another letter as we did for the
October Nominations - to continue to show our intent to nominate 100% of gas
to NWPL.  I think this may take some more thought - as I don't want to be
given the nomination and then curtailed 50% as other producers are.

Ken
