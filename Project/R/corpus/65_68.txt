Brett,
Have heard that Platter was given trading responsibility on EOL for offpeak California and other markets.   I heard he has done an awesome job and Richter & the gang are really happy with him.    He is motivated and challenged,  which is what he needed.  
As far as timing,  I dont know yet.     Could be next week or next month.    I kind of wanted to work on the Ercot desk,  but not for Presto.

Anyway,  keep in touch you wino.
