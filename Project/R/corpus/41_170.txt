Problem is that core has enough through utility retained gen and QF contracts 
and "noncore" is going to market, so they don't need any of it, which means 
it's both above market and not needed.

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed 
by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the 
deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the 
energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute 
the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that 
recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery 
period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below 
a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.
