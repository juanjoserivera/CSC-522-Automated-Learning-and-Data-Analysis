>FYI.  Please keep confidential.  John White's trying to go after the contracts.  Hap Boyd, who's on his Board, is opposing John's action and asking him not to go forward.  Too bad.  He was ready to launch.  Not sure what Hap's sensitivities are.  John's asked me not to intervene at this point.

Best,
Jeff
