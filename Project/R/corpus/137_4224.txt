That would be great.  We can leave his "stuff" by the front door.  I know he 
will have things he wants to bring to show you.

Michael asked me for advice yesterday.  ("Mom, I have a problem...").  He now 
has 2 girlfriends, Ashley plus a new one, Marilyn.  He was torn.  He decided 
to stick with Ashley. Oh, the problems of a 6 year old!!

Michael is very excited about the weekend.  He just doesn't think it will be 
long enough!!

Thanks for everything,

Kay

   No problem as far as I am concerned.  I can just pick up the
antibiotics and anything Michael has forgotten on the way back after I pick
him up.
