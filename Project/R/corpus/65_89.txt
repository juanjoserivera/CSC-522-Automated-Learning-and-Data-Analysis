Okay,  so we now have a procedure.   I will broadcast to the group and see that it is implemented.   I still havent completed all of their discrepancy checkout.
I have been working nights through the weekend and tonite.    I will address these on Tuesday.
Clint will be helping me to resolve these and future issues.

Thanks,
JMF
