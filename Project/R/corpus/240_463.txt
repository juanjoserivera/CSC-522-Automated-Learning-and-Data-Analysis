Gerald,
 
Thanks for looking at this for us.  When do you think you will have a chance to review it?  I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.  Also, do we need to have credit re-review?  Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.
 
Thanks,
 
Kim
