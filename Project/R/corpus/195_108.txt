My mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.  I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.  Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.  Just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news (and doctor prodding)...we'll grab a margarita next week sometime.
