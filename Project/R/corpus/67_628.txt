Per our discussion at lunch, excellent memo.  I don't know if it will make 
John and Rockey feel any better, but the emphasis on results is exactly the 
right message.

Subject: Kent Miller Promotion

Earlier this week, the Office of the Chairman announced that Kent Miller has 
been elected a vice president of Enron.

Kent is the first (of what I hope will be several) such promotion(s) under 
Enron,s new Performance Review Committee (PRC) process.  He and the other 
individuals selected for promotion to vice president and managing director 
were elected based on their track records.

In Kent,s case, he earned his appointment by demonstrating exceptional 
leadership, innovation and excellent earnings performance in developing NNG,s 
storage transactions, as well as in his other marketing responsibilities.

This round of promotions is noteworthy because it is the first based solely 
on outstanding accomplishments, rather than on the availability of open 
hierarchical positions.  As a result, while performance expectations continue 
to increase, there will be far greater opportunity for advancement throughout 
the corporation.

Please join me in congratulating Kent on this achievement.
