Hey,

Nice to hear from you.  No, I haven't done much celebrating yet.  Just work work work.  Anyway, ya, I still want to come up sometime, it's just a little less inviting than it used to be.  When is a good time now?  I'm going to Portland in two weeks for a couple of days, but pretty much free after that.  By the way, my NEW address is 2125 Sul Ross Rd., Houston, TX 77098.  Anyway, let's chat sometime... Talk to you soon.
 

Mat
