Darla,

This is what I have been able to find so far regarding fixed prices for citizens for Feb:

50,000/mo @ $7.55
50,000/mo @ $7.96
100,000/ mo @ $9.07

we also did a deal for 1,565/day @ $7.12.

Have they given you any information that you can compare this to?  Let me know if you have any questions and I will send you a spreadsheet with all fixed price deals I have done to date.  March and april should be final.  You can send me a monthly email when you are ready to do - say - mays invoice - and I will send you everything I have done with them.

Call me with questions -

Kim
