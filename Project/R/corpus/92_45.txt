That sounds great!  So will they get it all spread in one day?  Sounds like everything is taking shape now!!!

Not much going on here.  I had dinner with Rayfael last night, it was a little painful, but I survived.  He's so messed up
in the head right now.  :(

Anyway, nothing too exciting happening here....at least nothing that's gonna cheer you up...
