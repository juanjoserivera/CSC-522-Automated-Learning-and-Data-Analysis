hey there,
actually i forgot that fri is the first day of bid week which is a basically the 3 busiest business days of the month....when the nymex contract expires for june. anyways, it may be hard for me to commit to a time to get out of here and i think 330 might be early.  i will be in town the entire weekend and i have pretty much nothing on my plate, except make jam.  i know you are probably very busy so is there a better time for you?  we'll figure something out.
mo.
