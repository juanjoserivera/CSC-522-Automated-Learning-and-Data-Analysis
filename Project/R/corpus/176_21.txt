I agree that we should not move the business at this time, but we do need cross-training to occur.  Eventually the business should come here to Houston.  The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed.  My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction.  I also think that some of our counterparties are confused as to who to call concerning these types of deals and that trading decisions are being made in Denver without our knowledge until after the fact.  This is something that I have heard from you and Barry that should not be happening.

I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down.
