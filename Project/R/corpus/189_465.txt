Are we still on for Sun night?  I will let you decide where we are 
going.--somewhere near you is fine. 6- 6:30 is best. We will be with the kids.

October 8 it is.  I used the message at isbell's house to send you a message
and erased the body.  We are going just the four of us and the kids.  Where
do you want to meet?  what time?
