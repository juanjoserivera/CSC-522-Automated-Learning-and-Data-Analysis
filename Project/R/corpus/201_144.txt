Do I need to show you where in my house my study is?  (2nd floor of the 
house)  Also, will I be able to get email while travelling, etc?

Mr.Shankman,

;

We are installing Sprint Broadband a wireless Broadband service at your home. 
Sprint installs a 3ft by 2ft dish on your roof. This dish will be your & line 
&; or connection to Sprint. Sprint will install the dish and run a cable from 
the roof to your attic. From there the cable connects to a Broadband modem. 
This modem needs to be in the same room as your Home PC. If you choose to get 
a Wireless Network, we run the cable to a Cisco wireless Access Point. You 
can then use a laptop with a wireless network card anywhere in your house. If 
you have any ideas as what type of hardware you are looking please e-mail me. 
Also you can send this information to Jennifer;;;;
