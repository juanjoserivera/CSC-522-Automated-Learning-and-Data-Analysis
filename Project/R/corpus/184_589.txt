Hi Ellen

I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will provide you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that right?
