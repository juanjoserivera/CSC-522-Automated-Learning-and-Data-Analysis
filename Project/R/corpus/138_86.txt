Kelley,

Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual things happening in the "Fixed Float" markets in Texas particularily at HSC.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry Hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.31 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration.

Thank you,

Tom Martin
