I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.  Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday brunch places?
