Here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects....

3.  Agricultural Modeling

In an effort to help the Financial Trading Group begin effectively trading ag 
commodities, we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop model 
to predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forward 
weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is highly 
regarded in the agricultural modeling community.  One of the primary authors 
of this software, Joe Ritchie, has recently retired from Michigan State 
University and is moving to Texas.  Dr. Ritchie ahs expressed interest in 
providing assistance to us in setting up this software.  His new address is 
217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742.
His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has 
confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchie 
would be ideal for providing us the help that we need.

A second software product known as &Pcyield8 has been suggested.  Pcyield is 
based on the DSSAT model but is supposed to be more user friendly.  However, 
Dr. Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is 
probably the better fit for our needs.  The salesman for Pcyield is named 
Bill Bodine and he works for a company called Mpower 3.  He has indicated 
that he wants to visit us in Houston on February 2nd.
