Jimmie, agree; however, EES cannot immediately convey these agreements to EBSI as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy. Under bankruptcy, we need to show an auction process.  In the cases, where EBSI has contracted directly with the client - I think we are ok.

Vicki please add some texture if required.
