Thanks Luiz.  As a follow-up, I'd like to be on record as saying that the PUCT wasted my time in flying to Austin (when plane travel is not secure, I'd add) and not even listening to my statements.  Why bring us if they had already made the decision?  Also, I don't know who is going to pay for more Market Readiness work in SPP unless AEP agrees to pay our costs.  The customers pay for their activities.
