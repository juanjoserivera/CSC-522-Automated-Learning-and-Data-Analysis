Agree.  Still not at supply/demand equilibrium.  Unfortunately, market lacks a catalyst for sharp move down from here until bid week.  i think continue to see slow erosion.  think we are slowly running out of places to put gas.  discretionary storage guys have their belly full.  can see cash/futures just keep widening from here.  q/v spread, even though it widens every day, still has a long way to go.  think you get to V and there is nowhere to put the gas.  could see v/x going to 30+.  i buy every cantango spread i can.  when market moves up the winter goes 1 for 1, when the market goes down you make money.  strongest product in the gas market are nymex futures.  everything else is a bloodbath.  socal basis has gone from $10 to $4 in the past month.  canadian storage balances are ridiculous.  imports are going to blow away last year.   new lng coming in late novy.  rig count is like open interest, a straight line up.  gas is behaving very price inelastic, just like it did on the move from $3 to $5 last year.  see little hope.  
h/j is the craziest spread on the board.  it is not a fundamentally priced spread though.  for several reasons, the industry uses that spread primarily to link the front of the board to the back.  think the front will keep drifting lower and the back will find some customer buy support as we get cal 2 down to 3.75 ish.  thus, h/j has to come in...i think.  plus i have the fundamentals on my side.
