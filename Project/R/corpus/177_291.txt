Colin,

I left you a message at your hotel, but will try here as well.

give me a call when you get a chance

basically, the olap server is unresponsive (hangs IE when a cube is brought up)  and Chris
can't get a pulse using the OLAP manager.  We're contemplating rebooting the dev box, but
are afraid this will trigger the cube deletions we saw before.  any other tactics you can think 
of?
