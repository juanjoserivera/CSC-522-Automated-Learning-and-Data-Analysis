I will keep you posted on time and location for the meeting on the 11th.  If you join us for discussions on VP's, we will review Brent Price, Bob Hall, Peggy Hedstrom and Beth Apollo.  If you want to sit in on review of senior directors, that would pick up Leslie Reeves, James Scribner, Brenda Herod, Kevin Sweeney and Sheila Glover.  --Sally
