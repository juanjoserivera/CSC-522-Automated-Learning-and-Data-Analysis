I'm so glad to hear it! Cara suspected it was an EOL bug that had since been 
fixed. Thanks for clarifying this.

Subject: RE: AN EOL GLITCH THAT HAS TO DO WITH APRIL DEALS


Hello Cara,

We have determined that the EOL Bridge in production is currently working and 
handling time zone issue very well.
Back in June 2000, there is a bug, which related to time zone issue and we 
fixed it since then. All deals that you
provided to us had entered before July 2000.

We will run a query to identify if there are any other deals, which have 
similar problem with time zone.

Please let me know if you find more problems with EOL Bridge, we will fix it 
immediately.

Your help is highly appreciated

Regards,
dluu
