the couch is just right, i did make the beds to the best of my ability. i did not use wally wally. i did however leave a pot that was wet on the bottom that created a stain i forgot that granite is a porous rock it absorbed the water quite well i hope that it will dry out if not we will do what is necessary to fix it. i am totally serious about the granite
