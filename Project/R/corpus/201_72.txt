The connection to EOL or other web applications will be as fast as it is now, 
as this is solely dependent on your network hardware (cables, network card, 
etc.)  The mgiration to Windows 2000 will not impact this in any way.  One 
thing I need to verify though, do you use Stack Manager with EOL?  I did not 
see any instances of it on your machine, but I just want to double-check, as 
this program will not work under Windows 2000.


Thanks
