I know the following:

1) Gulf Plains plant is in Nueces County.  
2) Marathon on Tejas is Galveston County.
Check with George to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes.  I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.  For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.
