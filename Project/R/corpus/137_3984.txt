Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other 
type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the 
balance sheet.

Subject: RE: Midway Interconnect Agreement

If we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext, wouldn't the big 
concern be that we've put $1.8 million of land plus an additional $900,000 or 
so of obligations to build road and stormwater system on the balance rather 
than the rather small ongoing costs related to maintainance of the road and 
system?
