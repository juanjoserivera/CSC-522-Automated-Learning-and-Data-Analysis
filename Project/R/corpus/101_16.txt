Andy,

Coincidentally, I will be visiting London November 9th-11th and thought I might visit Enron's offices.

I am unaware of Amerax's penetration into the UK energy markets, but they are among the top three in North America.  As far as brokers go, Scott does a good job.  He is straight forward and honest and consequently was getting the largest share of our business in the west.

If you are interested, I would be happy to introduce you to Scott during my trip.  My schedule is fairly flexible.

Keith
