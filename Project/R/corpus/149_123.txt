John Sherriff and I are recommending Carol Hensley (VP Marketing and 
Communications at Azurix) for a VP position in John,s organization.  Carol 
was a director in the Enron PR group before moving to Azurix.  Her new role 
would be to support EnronCredit.com.  A critical success factor for 
EnronCredit.com will be to establish a strong brand in the coming months.

 In her time at Azurix, Carol has added significantly to her skills and 
experience.  I spoke with John Garrison at length about Carol,s performance 
at Azurix.  She has expanded her marketing services skills and provided 
significant support in the investor relations arena.  Garrison relates that 
the Azurix commercial leaders view Carol as a partner, informed about the 
business and instrumental in handling crises and pursuing business 
opportunities.

 John Sherriff and Ken Lay join me in recommending that Carol keep her VP 
title as she returns to Enron.  

 A copy of Carol's resume is attached.
