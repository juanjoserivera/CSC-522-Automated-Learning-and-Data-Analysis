Dave, 
Willis Philip and I are scheduled to arrive in Albany around 2:45 PM on Oct. 15.  That should give us time to meet you there by 4 pm, however, if we should be delayed I will give you a call.  I appreciate you taking time to show us around your facilities.  

Furthermore, we can all meet together when you come on the 22nd.  That should enable us to cover all the issues without redundancy.  I will talk to with Juan to firm up the exact meeting hours so that we can have an agenda for the day. 

Paul
