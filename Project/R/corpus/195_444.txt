Shelly,

Thank you for taking care of all the travel arrangements and interviews.  I look forward to meeting with yourself and the various other members of the Aquila team tomorrow in Kansas City.  The web page links you sent were very informative and certainly gave me a better understanding of Aquila and it's company culture.  I also wanted to let you know that I did complete the on-line application you referenced in your last email.  If there is anything else you need from me, please don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott
