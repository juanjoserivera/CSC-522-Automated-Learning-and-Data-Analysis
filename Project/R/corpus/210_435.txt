Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

Mat
