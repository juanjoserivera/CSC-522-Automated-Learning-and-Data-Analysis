It was nice meeting you too!  Please feel free to email or call anytime with questions or concerns regarding Austin.  I was impressed by the Study Skills program explained last night.  If this class was made a 6th grade requirement, I think it would go a long way in better preparing the kids for when they get to your class.

Best Regards,
