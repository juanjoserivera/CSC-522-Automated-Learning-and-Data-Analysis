Make sure the reservations are for the ocean blvd. patio side. ( not the patio in the back)  I hope this is not too much trouble.  We want to sit with the rock stars!!

Thanks,

Kim

we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride mountain,
paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by far
the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you
checking any bags?
