Interesting.... and probably true... I was watching the news last night and it is unbelievable how much scrutiny all of these assets are going to get in the next little while,  the reality is that everything could be a terrorist target... Nukes, water, tall buildings, stadiums,electrical generation assets, fuel depo's, crop dusters...
 
Pls keep us posted.. the implication here is that expansion projects like TransWestern could receive pressure on their ability to expand as the generation equation gets stirred up.
