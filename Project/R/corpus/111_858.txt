Iris,

Please, check with Shirley. She keeps my calendar up to date.

Also, we got a 2nd desk for you with the credit group
on the 23rd floor. You can divide  your time
bet the 19th floor and the 23rd floor to stay in touch with the
business unit. Please, check with Vasant and he will introduce you to the
credit team here in Houston (Jeff Kinneman, Craig Chaney).

Also, please plan for a trip to London in 3-4 weeks.

Hi,

    Thanks for your prompt response.

    Nalin Kulatilaka wants to visit when you are in town.  What are good 
Thursdays for you?

Thanks,
Iris
