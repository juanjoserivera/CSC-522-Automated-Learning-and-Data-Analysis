Reagan,

FYI, it would bother me if Marvin called our outside counsel.  If you want  
me to call David,  just ask.  I'll be glad to do it, although I don't suggest 
bugging the other parties' counsel too much.  It uses up relationship 
capital, and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want 
to incur.  

Another FYI -  I don't much like Enron commercial folks calling Enron outside 
counsel unless we've discussed it in advance.  It violates Enron policy.  So 
once we have outside counsel on board, you still deal directly with me, and 
I'll manage the outside resources.  It really works better that way.  

Kay

Kay-

I just called David Hunt and actually got him on the phone.  He said he was 
reviewing Marvin's and Bob's comments on His changes.  He committed to 
getting those to us directly.
