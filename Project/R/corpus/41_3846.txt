give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change, modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

best,
Jeff
