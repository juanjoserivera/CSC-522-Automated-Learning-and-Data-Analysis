I am attaching a revised form of the previous ENA Upstream GISB. Please send this version to your prospective customers. The FM language in the Special Provisions section has been removed.  Also, "DRAFT" and "For Discussion Purposes Only" should remain on the front page when sent to the customer.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  


Thanks
DP
