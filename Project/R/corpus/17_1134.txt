Thanks for the note.  I had received a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor ?Evaluation Form.  Today I also met with Jim and he provided me with his ?bullet points on your accomplishments and strengths, as well as your summary ?of accomplishments for the period.  If there is anything else that you think ?would be helpful for me to have, please let me know.  ??I will be in my office (EB3015) between 5:00 and 6:00 today and Tuesday ?without scheduled meetings.  If you would like to stop by so that I can put a ?name and face together, please feel free to do so.  This is my first day back ?in the office after vacation, so I have a lot of catching up to do, but I ?would be glad to visit with you for a while.  --Sally ?????Nicole Palczer@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 07/17/2000 12:02:10 PM?To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT?cc: James Row/Enron Communications@Enron Communications ?Subject: PRC Meeting??Sally,  ??Jim Row, my supervisor, let me know that you would be representing me at the ?PRC meeting on Wednesday.  I believe Jim's summary of my performance should ?offer a very good overview, but if you have any further questions for me, ?please feel free to call.??Many thanks,?Nicole??
