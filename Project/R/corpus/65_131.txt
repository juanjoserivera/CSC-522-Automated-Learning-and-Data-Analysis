Dave, its good to hear from you.
We are in Houston and its hot!   My wife is doing great and we are still trying to get used to life in Houston.     
I am trading in Ercot region (Texas) and, of course,  Brett is now working at the ISO.    
MY WIFE AND I MISS PORTLAND
Working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in Portland.    There is a good chance that I will return to PDX, as there are so many good people there and so much to do outdoors. 
So, tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix.    Everyone that I've met from SRP has been very nice,  (Perry,  John Sullivan,  etc.).   Hope you enjoy working there and all is well with your family.

JMF
