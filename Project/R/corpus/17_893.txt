Thanks for your note.  I am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear!  Let's hope for reveral of last year's score.  

Hope that 2nd year is going well.  I will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with Dean May and the Enron scholarship winners later in October.  --Sally
