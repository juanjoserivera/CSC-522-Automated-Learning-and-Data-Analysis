I'd prefer to wait on the call.  I'll be distributing my suggested 
refinements to and speakers for Rob's "Option 3" by COB today.

Subject: RE: Calendar Invitation


I thought we were going to wait til Lee talked to Shapiro and Borenstein.  
Does
anyone object to coordinating with them?  Since we hadn't heard any objection
Lee planned to call them agree to do it.  And in that scenario it seems to 
make
sense to hold our next call til they can participate so we can nail down a 
date
and time and initial speaker list with them.  We can't set a date til we know 
if
they're available.  Borenstein is available Fri Nov 17 but I don't know about
Shapiro.  If anyone has other matters to discuss we can go ahead with a call 
at
3 without Lee who is unavailable today.
