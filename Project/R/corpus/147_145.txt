Dale,

Thank you very much for hooking me up with Stephen.  It seems that he will probably be able to help me move some of my stuff directly to the US.  Could you please see that the address on my current accounts with RBC gets changed to my Houston location so I can receive statements going forward. The correct address is:

Jonathan McKay
909 Texas Avenue, #1808
Houston, Texas, 77002

Thank you very much.

Regards,

Jon
