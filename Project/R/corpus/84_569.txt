Mark -- If it's O.K. with you, I think it would be better for us here for any 
South America invoices to be sent to us in S?o Paulo, since that is where 
they'll be processed for payment.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Rgds,
 John

Marty -

I don't need the originals or copies of these invoices and defer to Haedicke 
and Novak on how they want them processed.  Thanks.

Rob
