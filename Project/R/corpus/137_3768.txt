Lee,

If this will be a dual fuel unit, it seems we should at least have a place 
holder guarantee, even if the details aren't included.  Any problem with that 
approach?

Kay

Kay/Peter- 

We don't need a liquid fuel guarantee at this time, since we don't know
where the dual fuel units are going.  When that is determined, we will
provide the LF guarantee at the time the site conditions are known.  Let's
press on.

Thanks,

Lee
