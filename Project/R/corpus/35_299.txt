Carol,

For your review, I've attached the adjustments our legal department is
proposing to the Consent to Assignment since receiving your red-lined
version from Rhonda Denton.  As to the transfer effective date, since we are
now into June, we would expect the transfer date to be as of July 1st.
Please let me know as soon as possible your comments on MEGA's most recent
proposed Consent to Assignment (attached below).

Thanks,
