Ryan,
 
Everyone else is going to be here on Monday so please feel to stay a few extra days.  We will have the normal closing stuff, (liquidations, PMA's, etc.)  I've already checked out our PMA's and we don't have anything to liquidate so it should be a piece of cake.  Things may pick up a little bit on Wednesday getting the books closed for the year.
See you then
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Kam
