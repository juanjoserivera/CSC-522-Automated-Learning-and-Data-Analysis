try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and "appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy.  fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer?  

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.  

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do you have a cell #?
