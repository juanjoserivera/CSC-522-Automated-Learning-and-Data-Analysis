I figure you are going to turn around and sell them on Ebay(current price is $77).  So, I will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $250, roughly $31 a sleeve.  I now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price.  I can send you a picture tonight, when I get home.  I can ship tomorrow or Saturday, I will pay for the shipping.  If you are interested, let me know.  Thanks.
