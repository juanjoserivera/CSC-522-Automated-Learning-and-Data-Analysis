No problem.  I didn't go out last night - just had a quiet evening.  I am 
having a great day - work wise.  Are you going to the shell open?

Hey, sorry I didn't get a chance to call you back.  we went to lunch and
didn't get back until after 2, and then I had class at 2:30.  How is your
day?  Did you go out last night?
