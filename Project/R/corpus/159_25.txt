GT,  The theme of the party sounds excellent.  What time is the party on 
Friday and where does the boat leave?  I may take a day of vacation.  I have 
more than I can probably use this year.

Gerald,

How are you brother? I'm doing fine. School is starting this Thursday so I
am working my ass off. Kind of anyway. (You know us state employees) I look
forward to Tailgate number 1. You are welcome to stay with me. Also, I am
having a huge party on a double deck boat. The name of the party is "No Le
Hace 99." That means "it doesn't matter" in spanish. (slang version means
who gives a f___.)The date is September 3rd which is a Friday. See If you
and Lisa can make it. You are welcome to stay at my house.

Talk to you later and Hook em Horns
GT
