Thank you Kay.  I do have the earlier versions and I will pass the document
on to the lenders.
Another condition precedent to funding tomorrow is getting a response from
GE as to whether they have any further comments on the documents circulated
to them yesterday, and whether someone from GE will be available tomorrow to
sign the letter circulated yesterday attaching the agreed forms of consent,
opinion and Turbine Contract.
I would be grateful if you speak to Kent Shoemaker and ask him to let us
know today whether he has any comments and whether a signatory will be
available on Firday morning to sign the letter.
Thank you
Isabel
