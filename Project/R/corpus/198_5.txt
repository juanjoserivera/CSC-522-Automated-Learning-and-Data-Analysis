Kristin, I have it on the calendar for Friday, October 13.  I also left 
Friday, November 10 on the calendar, too.  I'll check with him about meeting 
you vs. picking you up and let you know what he says.  Hope your having a 
good day - see you Saturday night.  SRS

i tihnk that fridays would be the best. So that friday the 13th would work.
I get out of class at 11:55 so if he wants to pick me up or i will meet hi
somewhere...it doesn't really matter to me. Just email me back and let me
know what he wants to do
