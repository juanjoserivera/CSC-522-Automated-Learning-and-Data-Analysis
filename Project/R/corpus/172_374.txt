Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch
