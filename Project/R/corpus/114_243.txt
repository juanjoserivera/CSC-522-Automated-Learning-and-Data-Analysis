I'm not sure yet.  I think we are going to be sending two memos  -- one that 
I am working on and on that Andy is working on.  It looks to me like the 
message below fits better into Andy's memo.  I don't think they will be 
combined into one, but I'll know more tomorrow.

Steve, Kevin Garland sent this to me hoping to get Jeff's approval to send it 
out from the office of the chairman.  Would it make sense to incorporate it 
into the memo you're working on?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS
