Mr. Ried,

I thought I'd drop you a line to inquire about the energy marketer position you have had open.  I understand you had the position open internally and that if you did not find a qualified candidate you would consider outside candidates.  I am currently awaiting an offer from UBS, the new owner of Enron's wholesale trading assets.  I want to reiterate my desire to return to Omaha and  to work for OPPD.  Please let me know of the status of your search for an energy marketer.
I can be reached on my cell at 503-701-9736.

Thanks!
