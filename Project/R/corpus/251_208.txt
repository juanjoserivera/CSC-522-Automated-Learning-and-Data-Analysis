I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.  Amy Felling should be your contact on the 19th.  She is most familiar with our computer systems.

The Enron North America offices are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750 in Downtown Denver.
The office is over 9,000 Square Feet but is currently under construction in order to sublease approximately half of that space.
We currently have 6 employees.
I believe that you have copied all of the Enron offices that I know of.

The only other potential office is EOTT.

Let me know if you need anything else.
