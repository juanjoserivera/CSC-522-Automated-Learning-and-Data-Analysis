Subject: NBP Underwriting Group

Attached is a short memo on our selection rationale for the underwriting 
group for a planned (mid-May) equity offering of about $130 - $150 million 
for Northern Border Partners.  Some of these firms may be contacting you, so 
this should be helpful in fielding those calls.  With this group we are 
attempting to balance our placement into firms that have substantial NBP 
holdings (UBS Warburg, AGE) and diversify and expand holdings in other major 
systems (SSB, Banc of America, First Union).  Please note that for the firms 
not selected, i.e. Lehman, Goldman and Merrill, part of our rationale was to 
hold these systems for a potential offering later in 2001 that could be 
accomplished on a sole-managed basis for up to about $50 million.

Kelly:  As Ben requested, the underwriting fees are expected to be about 
4.25% and the breakdown by firm will be provided when we have determined the 
allocations.

Let me know ASAP if you have any questions or concerns as we will begin 
discussions with these firms tomorrow.
