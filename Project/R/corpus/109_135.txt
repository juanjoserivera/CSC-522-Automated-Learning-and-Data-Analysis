Kal,

This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project
produced. Of course, they were free to say what they thought.

Our objective is to modify the article  to such an extent that
it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms
in the energy industry.
It would be only for internal consumption and it should be  a useful source of information 
for Enron employees.


Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.
