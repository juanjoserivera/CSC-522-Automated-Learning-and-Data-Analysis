John,
      I want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it.  All I want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week.  Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate, Forecast or both, I don't care.  Just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow.

Dan
