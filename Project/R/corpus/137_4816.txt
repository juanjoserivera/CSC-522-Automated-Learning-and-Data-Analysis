I don't see a problem with it.

Subject: RE: Message from Gisele Rankin

Kay and Lisa:

   We should probably let Gisele Rankin know by tomorrow morning
whether we agree with the proposal to revise the procedural scheduling order
to include a provision which will require final substantive orders to be
presented to the Commission by October 10.

   What are your thoughts?  Neither Allyson nor I can think of a
downside to agreement, and in fact we feel that it would be in our best
interest to agree to the October 10 date.

   Please advise.  Thank you.
