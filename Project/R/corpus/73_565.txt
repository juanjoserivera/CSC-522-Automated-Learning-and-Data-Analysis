FUNNNNNY!~!!!   No thanks on the recliner.  I think I want to get rid of my 
living furniture first and I may wait until I move to a bigger apartment.  My 
last electric bill was $22.00 - that's hard to beat.  I'm so pooooooor now.   
Let's see 1700 options witht the stock dropping $20 per share means no big 
down payment on a house.

Hey, would you like for me to bring your recliner home next time I go up?  I
think Debbie and I can get it into your apartment.  Thought it might be
comfortable for you to kick back in after you have recuperated from the
surgery.  I have to go and get a haircut.  I still have my fifteen chin
whiskers!  I just keep them trimmed short and neat.  Takes about ten seconds
to do that.  Baby likes them though.  She does not want me to ever shave
them fifteen little rascals off ever!!!

Bye,
me
