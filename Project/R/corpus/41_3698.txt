Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  Edison is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.
