Ernesto,

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Regards,

Paul
