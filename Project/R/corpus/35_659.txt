John:
I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send 
you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly 
that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are 
between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be 
issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party 
has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics 
need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these 
mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for 
some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.
