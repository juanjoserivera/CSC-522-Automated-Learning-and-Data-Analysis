The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.
