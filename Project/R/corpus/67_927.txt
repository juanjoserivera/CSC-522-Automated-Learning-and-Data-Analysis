Lou--could you cover the Derrick meeting on the 12th if Dot is stuck on a 
hanging jury?    Again, I expect to be on the phone from Cal., but would like 
one of you guys on also in Houston in case of telecom screwups (which follow 
me whereever I go).  Thanks.  df

 Drew- 

 Staff meeting on Monday the 9th -- no problem.  I would be glad to cover the 
Derrick meeting on April 12; however, 
 I have jury duty that day (yuck)!
