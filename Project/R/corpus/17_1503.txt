What does "completed" mean?  My first request was to give me access to review 
all e-mail messages that Mary has received since March 1 through yesterday's 
date.  I asked if they could be transferred to my mail box to simplify my 
review process.  Has this been done?  I don't see any new messages that have 
been transferred from Mary's mail box to mine.  --Sally
