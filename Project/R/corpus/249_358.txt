As you can see from various e-mails, Samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs.  I talked to Bob yesterday and he is aware that she is there and needing something to do.  Unofficially, he said that there should be no employee changes before the end of February, so Sam should start coming to work and taking over any specific West Estate requests.
