Amy & Ahmed,
	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!
	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy!
	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that!
	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing.
	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know.
	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton.
	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =)
	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.

Take care!
Love,
Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids
