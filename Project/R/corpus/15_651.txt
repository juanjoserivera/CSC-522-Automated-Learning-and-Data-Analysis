offered me a lesser trade than that already


my counter offer is 4,7,10 for your 2, 8

Eric,

I have done some investigating and here is the counter offer I am willing to
do.

I will trade you my 2 and 14 for you 3 and 5.  Let me know what you want to
do.

Ramiro would like to trade you his 13 for your 15 and 16.
