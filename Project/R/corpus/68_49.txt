I live day by day now.  I have no idea...At the minimum through the end of May. I 'm trying to save as much as I can so that i can take another couple of month when this gig is over.  whatever....How are you?  They better be treating you good or else?  I miss working with you guys.  we need to be sure we keep in touch.  How's Steve?  I heard he was having problems with his back?

luv ya!!!
