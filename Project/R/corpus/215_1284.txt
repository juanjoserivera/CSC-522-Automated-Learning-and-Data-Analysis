Lisa --

I haven't forgotten about trying to find a name.  Was on vacation in early October.  I will ask around for the right name.  

Hope Roger and you are doing well.  Grace is keeping Marianna and me very busy - she's now 19 months and pretty much runs the whole house.  

Talk with you soon, 

Jim
