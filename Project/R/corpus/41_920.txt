You know, generally, when I'm up in the morning, hanging around, getting 
ready to start the day, I can't see any reason to put clothes on.  I am much 
more comfortable that way.  Always been that way.

Good goal.  It would be easiest for me to have the meeting in SF.  Next 
week's fine for me.  Monday's a day off for me.  You?  Or we could set 
something up in the morning next week.  Just let me know.

Sorry for surprising you this morning!!  Nothing wrong with being
comfortable in your birthday suit.

Speaking of birthdays, I think we should have a goal to get my company
acquired by your company by May 30, 2001.  Good goal, huh??

I want to talk to you about the details I have been thinking about while you
were gone.  When should we talk??  Let,s set up a meeting so we make sure to
move this all forward.

Welcome back.
