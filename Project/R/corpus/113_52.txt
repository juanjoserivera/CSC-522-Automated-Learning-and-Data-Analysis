thanks Anthony.  It's difficult to see so many smart, hard working people in the kinds of circumstances you describe.  Unfortunately, I'm going through some of the same things (on a smaller scale).  We are having to let people go in my organization.  I simply don't have room, even for a qualified person like Maurice.
Does Global markets still have a presence in Singapore?  If so, perhaps there is an opportunity there.
