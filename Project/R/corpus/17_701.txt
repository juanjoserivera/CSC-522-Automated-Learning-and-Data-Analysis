1)  I believe that Tom Martin is talking with Chris Germany about taking the logistics role for the Texas region with Daren's planned departure.  Please coordinate with Tom and Bob Superty on where they are in this process of replacing Daren.  

2)  I am not sure that I know what database you are referencing.  He is on the current proposed org chart for Netco Energy Operations under Operational Databases (part of the Documentation team).  It is correct that his name is on the list that I provided to you yesterday.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.  --Sally
