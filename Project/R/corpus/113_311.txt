I believe I sent this to you earlier.  Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.  He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.  I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.  Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj?
