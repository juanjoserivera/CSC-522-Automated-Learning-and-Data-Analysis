I wanted to get w/ Steve Fisher to discuss the gathering of the different types of contracts that we spoke about in yesterdays meeting. As for the 1:00, I wanted to go over the fields needed to calculate the consumption bands. How much time do you have at 1:00, maybe we can consolidate these meeting and go over all of the fields with Steve and Glenn in the room.
