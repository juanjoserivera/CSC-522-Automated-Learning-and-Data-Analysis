Hey Mary Jo,

Sorry it has taken me so long to reply.  It sounds like a blast but I was unable to find good airfare.  I might check again today and if things change, I will let you know.  Thanks for thinking of me and for the invitation.  Maybe some other weekend - I do hope to see you again soon.

Kim
