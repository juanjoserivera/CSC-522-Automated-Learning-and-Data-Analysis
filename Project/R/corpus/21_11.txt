Ricki, I just wanted to follow up, I was told Cynthia and Linda neither
one had damage.  Cynthia's mother and sister had flooding and Linda was without
electricity for awhile.  If you are hearing something different, please
let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, below was the notice sent to employees that had flood damage.  While I was there, so was TK and she asked me if Linda Ward and Cynthia Rivers were included because she did not see them there.  I just wanted to make sure to pass this on to you.

Thank you,
Ricki
