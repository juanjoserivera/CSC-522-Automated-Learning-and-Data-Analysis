I hadn't heard the 2 1/2 hour deal, but then again, I wasn't on the call.  
I'll check on pushing the meeting back to 930 to give you a chance to get 
downtown before it starts.  Sheila, what do you think?

Subject: RE: GE meeting on Friday

The earliest flight gets me to Houston at 8:33.  Is that sufficient time
to get to your offices, or should I plan on flying in on Thursday night?
Also, it is my understanding from participating in the conference call
last week that the meeting is scheduled to last no more that 2 1/2
hours.  Is that still the plan?
