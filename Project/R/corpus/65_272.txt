cant make it tonight.   this is my 13th anniversary with the wife.    i am going to humble for some dinner.
we are going to florida on wednesday and will return on sunday.
the company down there is flying us out to take a closer look at the area.

it looks as if i have sold the audi.     a guy put a deposit down on it today and i am supposed to meet him tomorrow.
lets golf soon.
