Lad:  Sorry that I didn't respond.  I'm travelling.  Please call me on my cell phone 415.505.6633, or page me at 888.916.7184.  I'll be available beginning about 6:45 AM tomorrow.  Generally, there's going to be considerable support for the Bilas decision--at least from the lion's share of folks who made up the core of the settlement.
 
Best,
Jeff
