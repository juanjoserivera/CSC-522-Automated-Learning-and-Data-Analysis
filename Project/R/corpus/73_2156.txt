Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin.  We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel, outside counsel (which is seperate), and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone.  I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts.
