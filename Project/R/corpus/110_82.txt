Traci:

I am forwarding you the resume of Marilyn Mielke. She is a very highly
educated and accomplished person. She has a background in science but 
no skills required in my group. I was impressed with her excellent
communication and social skills - maybe she can acquire
necessary skills going through the Analyst/Associate program.

She was knocking on the Enron's door for a long time.
