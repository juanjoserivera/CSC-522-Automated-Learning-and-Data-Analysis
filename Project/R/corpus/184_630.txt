We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.  Also Do we need to include the 2,400 from Suntrust in my mom's estate since it was held by both my brother (who closed the account this weekend) and my mother?
Thanks
