Inja,
Hello from South America.  
By way of this email I will ask Cathy Phillips to send you a bio and picture 
as requested.  I will present the Net Works story and EOL in a presentation 
if they would like.  The EOL presentation and statistics are very cool.  I 
don't have a lot to send them in advance but you can say that ENW is changing 
everything on our new approach to business and it will be huge.  Let me know 
if there is something else that I can do.

Thanks,
mike

Subject: Meeting with SK top Executives

Hi Mike,
In preparation for your meeting with SK,s top people: Mr. Tony Chey (SK 
Corporation chairman)   and Mr. Han Kyung Kim (President of SK Corporation), 
I was asked to get some of your background information   I also thought it 
might be helpful to provide you some information about them and what they are 
looking for as I understand it . 

I.  Information Requested & Discussion Topics:
-  They are requesting some information about you and your career history 
which they would like to receive as much before the meeting as possible - 
please send it to me via email and I will pass it on to them
-  Your view of Enron Net Work,s contribution to the overall world-wide Enron,
s future business (They have a great deal of interest in EOL and other future 
IT business world-wide) and the Enron Broadband Services and EOL's impact on 
Enron's stock price

II.  Information about SK chairman & president
A. Tony Chey (SK Corporation Chairman & owner)
-   Tony Chey is the brain of  the entire SK group  and very much respected 
in Korea
-   He is  known as a forward thinker and  the moving force of the company
-   SK Corporation has over 40 subsidiaries including SK-Enron, SK-Global 
(general trading company including petroleum and chemical products 
(interested in future B2B), SK-Telecom, SK-Computer and Communication 
(computer system integrators),  SK-Life Insurance, SK-Oxi Chemical, 
SK-Securities, and many others  
-   Approximately 40 years of age with Master's degree in Economics from 
University of Chicago
-   According to the newspaper article, he believes  that success of the  
21st century business will depend on managing intangible assets like 
knowledge.  He also believes that the advent of information and 
telecommunications revolution requires  change in the business environment 
and  business can only survive if it adopt this change.  He also mentioned 
that the new business should be based on knowledge instead of previous 
models.  
-  He is a proponent for SK,s OK Cashbag product (internet retail product 
sales site B2C)  - which supposedly spent some $80 million USD with all out 
advertisement  on TV.  Currently,  this product is losing money.  Therefore, 
other SK senior management are concerned about our e-Commerce project. 

B.  Mr. Han Kyung Kim (President of SK Corporation)
-    He is about 58 years old and No. 2  man in SK group.  He has over 35 
years experience in SK and has strong background in petroleum trading.  He is 
less directly involved in e-Commerce.

anything else I can do to help prepare for your visit.
