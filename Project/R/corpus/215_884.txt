I would think that we should take the time to talk with local counsel or other "allies" to get a feel for the chances in AZ.  I also think that the difficulty in AZ will be a physical problem with getting transmission service - no RTO.

It would be great to have a thorough analysis of problems in every open market just to know what the issues are.
