Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300
Lamar Street) about 7:15.  Just let me know, otherwise I will take a cab.

Where should we meet with Jeff tomorrow at 8:15??

Kevin
