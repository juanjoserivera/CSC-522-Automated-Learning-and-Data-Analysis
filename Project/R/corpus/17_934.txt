Thought that my e-mail message to you last week asked for a moratorium on contacting London re: Doorstep Reviews until I circled back with you after conversations with Buy and Causey.  Sounds as if that moratorium either wasn't communicated or wasn't observed.  

Causey left me a voice mail message on Sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all EEL reviews at present.  Still waiting on Buy.  I will find him today.
