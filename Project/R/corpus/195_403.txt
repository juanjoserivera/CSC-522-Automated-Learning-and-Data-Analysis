Thanks Kathy...

Would you mind letting me know when I have access to the curve validation file in the O:// drive, or if there's anything I need to do to secure those rights.  Currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes.  Chance Rabon has said he will do some research and I've contacted some of the traders from the West Desk who were in charge of collecting that information.
