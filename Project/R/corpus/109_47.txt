Bjorn,

I don't think the scope of the project is really that big. When we looked
into it, it seemed like a relatively minor issue. 

To me, it's  really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be
an equivalent of a Desert Storm operation.

Zimin and I will call Slava on Tuesday and determine what has to be done.
