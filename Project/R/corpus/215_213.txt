We are trying to identify assets and contracted positions that Enron will either own or control in ERCOT to process the PUCT merger analysis.

If you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know.  If you want to discuss, please feel free to call me at 3x7673.

Thanks.

Jim
