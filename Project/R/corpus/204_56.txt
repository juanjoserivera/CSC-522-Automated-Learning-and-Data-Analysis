Fundies:

Due to rotations we need six analysts in Aug/Sept.  Chris has been assigned three new analysts from the pool.  I believe these people are outside of the 26 assigned to you.  We need a minimum of three.  If you want to give us up to six, we will send our allocation of three back to the pool.  We would also like a summer analyst.
