Ed,

I got your fax.

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business
hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing
sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs
and references to LTCM and MG. I am afraid they can be taken out
of context and misinterpreted.

Thanks
