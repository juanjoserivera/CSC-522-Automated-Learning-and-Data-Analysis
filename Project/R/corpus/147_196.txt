Melba,

Chris Lambie, Chris Dorland, Mike Cowan, and Chad Clark will be managing products.  All Canadian traders will need transaction capabilities.  I do not think that any "view only" access will be needed.

Thank you,

Jon


PS. I am moving to Houston permanently tomorrow and will have to pass this responsibility off to Chris Lambie.
