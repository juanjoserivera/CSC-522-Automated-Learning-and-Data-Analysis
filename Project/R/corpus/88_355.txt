Sorry to hear about Dirk.  I will certainly let you know if I hear of anything.  We don't need any samples at Kravet--we have found a piece of their fabric that we are pretty sure we want to get.  The contractor is starting work on our house Monday, so our fun will be beginning.  Talk to you later.
