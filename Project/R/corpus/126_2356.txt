daily dose on enron - 

we are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket.
