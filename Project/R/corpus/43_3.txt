Subject: RE: This weekend


Guys, unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to bow out of our camping
trip this weekend. I have been rather ill over the last week and a half, and
I'm not sure that I'm up for the elements and all of the alcohol that are
involved in this weekend's festivities. I have been hoping to get better,
but between work and my cold, I don't think I'm up for it. Have fun and
please try not to make too much fun of the "silent one" while you are in a
wood kicking frenzy.
