Cindy,

How long would we have until we need to release the rooms to avoid the 
charge?  I  think your suggestion will work.

Hi Kay,

I'm so happy that you guys are coming to visit us.  May 4 - 7, 2001 are
great dates for your group to come, however I can not block rooms due to our
availability at this time.  .  The only way I can guarantee the rooms is to
get a $3000 pre-payment to hold the rooms.  If you would like to hold that
on your credit card until they call with their own, I can do that.  I  will
keep an eye on it for you and if you just want to have everyone call me as
soon as they can or I can call them.

Just let me know how I can make this easiest for you.  Do you know if your
group wants signature or premier rooms?

See you soon.
