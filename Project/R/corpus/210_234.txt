Hey, what up?  i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.  Had a pretty cool time this weekend.  Checked out Hood River, a little town on the Columbia River Gorge and then headed up to Mt. Hood yesterday.  I think its about 11,000 ft high. There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost snowing!  Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don't think many people do.  The little trip made me think about our ski plans, which we should definitely keep pursueing.  I apologize i'm a little out of touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance.  So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comfortable hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to earth.  She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some common interests there.  She's totally not into fancy expensive things...which is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can teach.  Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i guess you can't have everything...
 
Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.  I have to run.  Thanks for the email. 
 
Talk to you soon.
 
Mat
