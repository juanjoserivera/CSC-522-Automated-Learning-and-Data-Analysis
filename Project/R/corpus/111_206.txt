Soussan,

Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the Galleria.
I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?). 

You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.
