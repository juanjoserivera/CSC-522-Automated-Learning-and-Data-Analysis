Barbara and Anne:

Below is an e-mail I sent to schedule a meeting with the confirm desks to discuss the materials we will need in order to start the review of the confirm templates.  Do you want to attend?  If so, I will notify you once I hear from everyone else as to their availability so that we can schedule a meeting that we all can attend.

Thanks!

Marie
