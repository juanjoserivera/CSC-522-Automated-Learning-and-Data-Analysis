How about 9 am Houston (10 am New York)?   Why don't you call me?  It might 
be helpful for Scott to be available (we could conference him in if 
necessary).  Let me know if this works.  SS

I will call you in the am.  I am free until 11:30 NYT. What works for you?
Do you want a business person like Scott Talento on the line with us?
