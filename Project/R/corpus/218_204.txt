What is weird is that Jeff S. is still in the building, so it must have truly been his decision. They are issuing more stk, but I have not yet heard the details on how that will work. As far as Greg, I have heard very little on what lead up to his final departure. I know that his son had just had an operation and I think there may have been some complications. Then throw in a new born and watch the stress level rise.
