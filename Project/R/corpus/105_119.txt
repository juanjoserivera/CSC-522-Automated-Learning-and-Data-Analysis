thanks Blair, we've been following the FR debate very closely.

Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contracts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the original 1996 El Paso settlement.  The indicated shippers last year did file a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selling its capacity.  This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in getting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project.
