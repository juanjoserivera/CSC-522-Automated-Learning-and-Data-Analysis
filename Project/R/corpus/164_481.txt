Beth,

Thanks for your e-mail.  This will put us in agreement.  I have incorporated 
our changes as discussed in the following revised Section 13.  If you are in 
agreement,  I will prepare execution documents.

Section 13 is further modified by inserting the following new Section 13.10:

Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is 
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the &Repurchasers8) to 
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  The parties 
further agree that the term &Transporter8 when used in this Contract, 
including, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11., shall include any 
company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree 
that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such 
Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the 
same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that all 
parties scheduled and nominated the same volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled 
and nominated on hehalf  of  such Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s).  

Many thanks for your assistance with this matter.
