		 Subject: One-pager


Regarding the one-pager we discussed today and for discussion in a later 
call, I wanted to offer a suggestion on an approach.  I,d like to see 
something simple that uses headings to show what Enron has done, what 
concerns remain, and the steps you expect to take in the future. 
I've put together some very rough sample bullet points (below) as a start to 
get everyone thinking and as an example of a format that could be effective.  
A short preface should also be added to set up the bullets, possibly 
something that says Enron has been working diligently to meet elements of the 
committee's subpoena despite remaining disgreements.

What Enron has done:
Delivered x number of documents
Spent x man-hours compiling information requested by the committee
Retained a depository in Sacramento for documents
Negotiated in good faith on a continuous basis with the committee
Enron,s concerns regarding delivery of additional documents:
The committee has failed to implement an acceptable confidentiality agreement 
that includes sanctions for anyone who breaches the agreement
Confidential documents held by the Legislature -- such as in the Quackenbush 
case -- have historically found their way to the press or made public, often 
in a selective manner
The broad nature of the committee,s request and whether requested documents 
are relative to this inquiry
Whether a state legislative committee has jurisdiction over activities that 
involve interstate commerce
What Enron will do:
(Bullets on planned steps)
