Group,
We all knew it was coming. NERC Compliance surveys are continuining. Everything must be tagged both light load and heavy load. THIS INCLUDES SCHEDULES IN THE SOUTHWEST. Templates and POR/POD sheets are available. If you have any questions regarding our policy please let me know.
Let's be especially sharp for HE 14 on the 17th.

Thanks,
Bill
