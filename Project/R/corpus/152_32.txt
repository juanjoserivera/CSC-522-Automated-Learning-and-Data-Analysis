Hey, how are you,  Yes, I'm still here, I'm doing well. 2001 was not a pleasant year for alot of people, and it was certainly no exception for me.  Along with my favorite company going bankrupt, my father passed after a lennghty illness.  But all is well for the time being.  Nice to hear from you.  Tell everyone I said hello.

Thanks for thinking of me!
