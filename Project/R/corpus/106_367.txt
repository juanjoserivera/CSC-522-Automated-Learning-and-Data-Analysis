Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
Antonio which govern payments by Customer."

There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...
