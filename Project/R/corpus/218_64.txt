Hey bud,
	I am now officially out of VM and working on the EES mess. I will give you details later, but in a nut shell I will be spending a lot of time in Houston over the next 6-mths. Looks like I will be working with Richter on try to sort out the issues that we currently are having w/ EES.  Did you get a house yet? Also, set up the MSN IM so we can talk.

				Chris
