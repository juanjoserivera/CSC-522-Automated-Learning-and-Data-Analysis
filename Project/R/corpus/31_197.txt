Thanks for the draft.

Delaware is the proper state.

I thought the deferral information was sent to you already.   There is no 
"plan" document per se.  Instead, there is a description of the program.  I 
will re-send that to you today if you don't already have it.

Please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, for a time to have a conference 
call on the other question.  My morning today is wild; tomorrow probably is 
better.  

Thanks.

Michelle
