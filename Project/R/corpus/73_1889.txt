Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American

310,000 dth x $2.47 per dth = $765,700.00

Goods and Services Tax  $765,700.00 x 7% = $53,599.00

Total Bill = $765,700.00 + $53,599.00 = $819,299.00

Priscilla, do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax?
