Sign us up.  BUT, I may be WHO KNOWS WHERE sowing all my wild oats with half naked Brazilian women.  I don't have that many oats left anyway, it could just be an oat.  By the way, Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert.  I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.  I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar.  Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.  I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.

I'm off to another wild day of tariff review.  Call me when you can, it brightens my day and wakes me up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Later Gator
Boo BOOO
