Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we 
will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add 
the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of 
"Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron 
entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly 
default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we 
are trying to carve those transactions out.  

Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB 
agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from 
the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised 
draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.

Tana,

Hope you are well.  I wondered whether you had had any progress on the final
form of the Deutsche Schedule yet? or any progress on the FUNB documents?
Thanks for your help in keeping us up to date on the status here.

Best regards,

Clare
