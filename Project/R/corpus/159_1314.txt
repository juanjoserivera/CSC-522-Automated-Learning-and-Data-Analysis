We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.   

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.  Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?
