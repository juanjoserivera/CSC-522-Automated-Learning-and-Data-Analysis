i don't have a problem with that.  The 3 factors I ask in releasing info are:

	1. Do customers even know the info is available or useful?
	2. Is the info publicly available?
	3. Is the info easily obtainable?

	In this case, the answer is yes to all three, so I don't care.  If the answer is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.
