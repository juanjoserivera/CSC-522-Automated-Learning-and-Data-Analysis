Laura,

Sorry for a delay in responding to  your previous message.

My boss, Greg Whalley will be traveling a lot during the next 2 weeks, 
visiting different offices of Enron. It seems at this point that we may be able to
visit  you in Santa Fe in the first part of the week of September the 3rd.
Please, advise me of your availability.

I apologize for our inability to commit to a firm date at this point. I would like to assure 
you of our continuing interest in working with you in the future.


Vince
