thanks for your help as always.  i think we might try the auberge place.  if
you ever decide to get out of the energy business i think you have a place
as a travel consultant.  You need a break?  you were just in scottsdale.
how drunk was kevin mcmahan that night, i was worried he was going to follow
you up to your room.  i have seen him drunk, but nothing like that....
