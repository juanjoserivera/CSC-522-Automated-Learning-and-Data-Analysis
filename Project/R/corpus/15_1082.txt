hey dad,
 
austin was fun.  michael ballases and i went up for the day and met up with his family b/c it was parent's weekend.  it was good to see them again.  i am anxious to see how we play against OU.  i am starting to have a good feeling about this team. they looked really sharp on saturday - especially the offense.  
 
shanna and i will come out for jason's b-day on wednesday. i don't know what time yet but it should be around 6:30.
 
see ya then
