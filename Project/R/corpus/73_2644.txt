Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in Katy.
