I'm trying to meet a deadline at the moment, but are you free this 
afternoon?  I have some information that can help a lot in that analysis.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks Jeff.  On a related note, we are trying to put together a financial 
"headroom" forecast for DWR/State of California that goes out a few years and 
shows:  

Rate Revenues
less:  Utility gen costs
 QF costs
 DWR PPA's
 DWR spot purchases
Margin
Total Deficit

Bond Issue
Bond Principal & Interest

Would you know how to get something like that? 

Regards,

Chris
