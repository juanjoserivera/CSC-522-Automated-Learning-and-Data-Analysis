hey!

We are all fine.  How is Miller?  Did he survive the trip to Lubbock..  Ha!  He's right the aggies always get kicked in the cohones by the Red Raiders.  Must have been a good game.  I am officially poor now thanks to Enron's financial wizards.  You have to be glad you left.  drop me a line.  Take care!
