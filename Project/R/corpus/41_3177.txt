No problem.  Man, for someone who doesn't know much, you sure know alot, based on the note you sent.  It's your call on today's lesson.  If you're feeling under the weather, then we can pass for today.  Otherwise, I'll show up at 4:30.  Just let me know.  And you can decide anytime between now and 3:30.  I don't know how much Eldon and Rory can help, but they're both real knowledgeable and generally love thinking about this kind of stuff.
 
Best,
Jeff
