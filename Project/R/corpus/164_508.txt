Beth,

Regrettable, but upon final review, my attorney requested the following 
change to read as follows:
"..any such Repurchaser, Enron and NEGM....."

Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is 
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the &Repurchasers8) to 
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).    The parties 
further agree that the term &Transporter8 when used in this Contract, 
including, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11, shall include any 
company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree 
that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such 
Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the 
same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any such 
Repurchaser, Enron and NEGM  scheduled and nominated the same volumes as 
Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on hehalf  of  such  Repurchaser at 
the Delivery Point(s).  


Please let me have your thoughts.  Many thanks.
