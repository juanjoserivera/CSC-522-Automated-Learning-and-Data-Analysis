FYI - the only other temporary information I can give you is Thursday Feb 7. is simulation date (as per previous e-mail) and Monday, Feb. 11 is the current 'go live' date.  I'll try to keep you up to date with any changes.  If there is ANYTHING we think we have not done or will not complete by next Wednesday, Feb. 5 such as desk set ups, RisktRAC set up (including hierarchies), individual roll set ups, testing of Min's new DPR Automation, and anything else I may not be thinking of, please let me know as soon as possible, so we can get the right resources working on it.

Thanks,
Stacey
