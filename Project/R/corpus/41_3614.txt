The writer fails of course to mention that Clinton (with bi-partisan support) bombed the shit out of bin laden after the embassy attacks.  Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that  the families of the victims are thinking about at this time.
