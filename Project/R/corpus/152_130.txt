You are so nasty!!!!!!! Who is Henry (that get's on your nerves)? I can take a breather anytime now.  I have an 11:45 meeting today and then after that, it's just wait and see.   I am thrilled for you, you deserve everything you're receiving now and so much more!!! 

I too am very glad to be your friend...I only wished that we lived in the same city and could visit more often.  When God put us together, he knew what he was doing, AS ALWAYS!  

I love you my sister.

Also, you need to be careful on the e-mail and use code words, if you know what I mean.  You know I know how to READ!!!

Love ya!
