Art,

The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day delivered @ San Juan would be $.48.  For Q3 only, the premium would be $.49.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have questions or need anything else.  I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest.

Thanks,

Kim
