We'll be at the party, Overture, or no Overture.

The Squaw thing ain't a problem.  No worries.  But let's settle soon.  My 
accounts are a little wacky these days---I'll explain later.  Thanks for 
letting me know.

With the playing, there's a lot of little issues that I think are no big 
deal, but from our weekend at Squaw, it seems that there are some major 
fucking huge issues that you and the mighty C needed to work out.  If you've 
got those worked out, then I'm all fer playing again, though the next 2-3 
weeks are pretty fucking ugly.

Best,
Jeff

All,

I hope you guys can come this Friday to the dinner party at Sarah's house. 
It will be the four of us, Kent, Allison, Bobby, Sarah, and one of Sarah's 
friends called Mari, who was at the post-Hillman rock party. (Riddles is in 
La Paz, Mexico, being the smart guy that he is.) I have conceptualized the 
menu personally--hopefully Cameron and Sarah can carry it out. Also, I think 
there'll be a case of Overture. If that doesn't entice you, I don't know 
what will. I would really love it if you guys could be there. 31 is no big 
deal beyond an excuse to get dead fucked up...

I also checked into the Squaw fiasco, and I hate to report that all that was 
charged to my card was a measly $24.61. So, we'll have to discuss the 
settling of that bill. Sorry for the inconvenience, Jeff.

At the risk of sounding too much like Nancy... I think it would be nice if 
we could try to play music again. I picked up the damn mandolin so that I 
could actually play, not just practice in my room all alone! I know that 
there are many issues that arise between all of us, but maybe we can talk 
about them individually and together, and then try to simply be more mellow, 
have more fun. That doesn't mean that we can't "practice;"  however 
everything must be done in the spirit of enjoyment. All this is pretty 
obvious to all of us, and I don't need any of you to address this issue in 
e-mail, but we've had a lot of good times playing together, and I would like 
us to rise above this and move ahead, and perhaps get to a better place. 
After all, summer is on the way, and we want to be able to impress our 
teachers and mentors. I think of poor Bridget having to sit through the same 
show we gave her last year. What will she say to Ed!? If not, the sidekicks 
are going to have to go on tour.

I love you all and hope this finds you well,

Scotty
