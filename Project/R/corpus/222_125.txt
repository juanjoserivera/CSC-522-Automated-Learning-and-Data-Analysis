As you know, the deadline for filing for the March primary for judicial 
elections was January 4th. The following incumbent judges drew no opponents:

          Name                      Office                       Amount 
budgeted

1. Pricilla Owen   Supreme Court   $10,000
  2. Mark Davidson  11th  District   $500
3. John Donovan   61st District   $1000
4. Harvey Brown   152 District   $1000
  5. Tim Taft   1st  Court of Appeals  $250
   6. John Anderson  14th Court of Appeals  $250
   7. Harvey Hudson  14th Court of Appeals  $250
  8. Richard Edelman  14th Court of Appeals  $250


I would be shocked if these candidates even had fund-raisers at this point. 
Please let me know what you want to do about these uncontested raises.

I have requested $500 for Martha Hill Jamison.  My sources tell me that the 
Republican activist groups (Steve Hotze) will be supporting Frank Gerald over 
Martha Hill Jamison.  Perhaps we should hedge our bets on this race.  Let me 
know what you think.

There is another race that we have never talked about that I would like you 
to consider.  Michael Stafford is the First Assistant to Michael Fleming, the 
County Attorney.  He is running for Johnny Holmes' office.  This may fall 
under Joe Allen,s umbrella, but I think  there is a tremendous benefit to 
giving some money to Mike Stafford.  Steve Radack has informed me that he has 
the "downtown establishment" support.  If he wins, great.  If he loses, we 
look good to Mike Fleming and to Mike Stafford.  I can personally attest that 
Stafford had tremendous influence of the County Attorneys, office.  This may 
come in handy at  a later date.  Again, I look to you for guidance.
