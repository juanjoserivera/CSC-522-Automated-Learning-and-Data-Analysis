George, below is my first cut at the brief announcement.  As we discussed it 
may be combined with a Jay and Allan announcement but never the less it will 
go out friday evening.

Please make recommendations and return as soon as possible for my review.

Thanks,
mike


George Wasaff, MD for Global Strategic Sourcing, will be moving direct 
responsibility for his entire organization from Enron New Works to Rick 
Causey,s organization.  This global  group has been very successful in 
developing and executing its new business and we believe that this is the 
best fit in the organization to complete its aggressive goals and 
objectives.  George will report directly to Rick Causey.
