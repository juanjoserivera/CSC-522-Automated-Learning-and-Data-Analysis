Though I had a somewhat different notion when I initially raised the idea of 
co-sponsorship, I agree with Lee's observations and think that we should 
proceed the way he suggests.

Subject: FW: Possible co-sponsorships


All,
Lee asked me to forward this.  I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from
anyone on speakers.

I guess Lee's e-mail changes things.  If the business school wants to go 
forward
with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one.  
Jeff
has said he likes the idea of coordinating.  Bill and Allen, what do you 
think?
I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief
economist at DOJ.  As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford
economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than
anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,
Australia, and California.  He speaks a mile a minute though and his
understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive.

I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute.  I heard from Michael
Berg this morning.  So he will not be participating in our discussions either.

My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school.  One positive outcome 
of
this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch
economic policy faculty.  Overshadowing is possible.  Lee, does Dean Nacht 
have
a view on joint sponsorship?
Rob
