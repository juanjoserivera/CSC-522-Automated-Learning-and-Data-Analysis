When is graduation?  And, of course I will show up.  Although, if I recall, 
you didn't show up for mine!
You can send the announcement to 2512 Milam St. #5216, 77006.
I haven't heard of the advertising firm.  What kind of projects do they work 
on?   I am going to Earth Day. Are you?  Are you bringing Rebecca again this 
year? 
We will probably go out to Kenneally's, Griff's or Birraporetti's for St. 
Patty's day.  What about you?

The fam is doing well.  Dad has been travelling for work and the rest of the
fam, just relaxing I guess.  This is spring break for the girls, so they
haven't been doing too much!  So, where do I send my graduation
announcement?  Do you think you will be able to show up?  Or are you too
busy?  I'm sending my resume to an advertising firm in town, today, Daily
Communications, have you ever heard of them?  Are you still thinking about
going to earth day?  What about st. Patricks day, are you doing anything?
