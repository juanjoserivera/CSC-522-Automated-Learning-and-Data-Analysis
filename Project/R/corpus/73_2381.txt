We are double checking your work and this is what I have on my swing worksheet.

Day May	Volume		GD	GD +.10	Amount
3		1196		3.665	3.765		4383.34
4		1479		3.73	3.83		5664.57
8		692		3.51	3.61		2498.12
17		2000		3.455	3.555		7111.00

	Total	5367					$19,657.03

I'm using the Zone 2 gas daily.  Are you using a different gas daily?  Let me know where the differences are.  Also, would you let me know what days we did not get the baseload gas please.

thx
