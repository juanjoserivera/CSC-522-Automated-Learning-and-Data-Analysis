Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis II.  They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by the end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers again.  Later.
