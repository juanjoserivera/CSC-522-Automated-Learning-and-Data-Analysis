Edmund:

(1)  I thought you said that there were specific transactions in the U.S. entities.  I need a list of trades booked in the names of Enron Credit Inc. and Enron North America Corp.

(2)  I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.

(3)  I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.  I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc.
