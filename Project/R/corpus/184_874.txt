Hi Scott

Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.

Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.  I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to "release" the document - after release we do not want to "re-release" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page. 

   This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments
