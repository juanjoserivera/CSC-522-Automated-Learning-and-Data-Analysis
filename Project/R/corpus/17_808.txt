Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed. 

I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues.  

I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.  

I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that I had not known before.  Seems like a good group.  --Sally
